could we see violence no matter who wins on november th lets hope that it doesnt happen but as you will see below antitrump violence is already sweeping the nation 
if trump were to actually win the election that would likely send the radical left into a violent postelection temper tantrum unlike anything that we have ever seen before alternatively there is a tremendous amount of concern on the right that this election could be stolen by hillary clinton and as i showed yesterday it appears that voting machines in texas are already switching votes from donald trump to hillary clinton  if hillary clinton wins this election under suspicious circumstances that also may be enough to set off widespread civil unrest all across the country 
at this moment there is less than two weeks to go until november th and a brand new survey has found that a majority of americans are concerned about the possibility of violence on election day 
a  majority of likely voters express at least some concern about the possibility of violence on election day one in five are very concerned three of four say they have confidence that the united states will have the peaceful transfer of power that has marked american democracy for more than  years but just  say they are very confident about that 
more than four in  of trump supporters say they wont recognize the legitimacy of clinton as president if she prevails because they say she wouldnt have won fair and square 
but many on the left are not waiting until after the election to commit acts of violence on wednesday donald trumps star on the walk of fame was smashed into pieces by a man with a sledgehammer and a pickax 
donald trump took a lot of hits today and not just in the presidential race with less than two weeks to go before america decides if the ex apprentice host will pull off a surprise victory over hillary clinton trumps star on the hollywood walk of fame was destroyed early wednesday morning by a man dressed as a city construction worker and wielding a sledgehammer and pickax in what looks to be a tinseltown first 
and there were two other instances earlier this year when donald trumps star was also vandalized one came in january and the other happened in june  
this is of course not the first time the gop candidates star has been attacked or defaced since trump announced his white house bid in summer  the most extreme measure was a reverse swastika being sprayed on the star at  hollywood blvd in late january in june this summer a mute sign was painted on trumps star in a seemingly protest against the antagonistic language and policies some have accused trump of promoting and reveling in during the campaign in both cases trumps star was quickly cleaned and back as new within a day 
we have seen antitrump violence on the east coast as well earlier this month someone decided to firebomb the republican party headquarters in orange county north carolina on the building next to the headquarters someone spraypainted nazi republicans get out of town or else along with a swastika 
there have also been other disturbing incidents of antitrump violence all over the nation in recent days a recent lifezette article put together quite a long list and the following is just a short excerpt from that piece 
on oct  in bangor maine vandals spraypainted about  parked cars outside a trump rally trump supporter paul foster whose van was hit with white paint told reporters why cant they do a peaceful protest instead of painting cars all of this to make their statement 
around oct  a couple of trump supporters were assaulted in zeitgeist a san francisco bar after they were allegedly refused service for expressing support for trump gotnews reports the two trump supporters were attacked punched and chased into the street by some thugs that a barmaid called out from the back lilian kim of abc  bay area tweeted a photo of the men in which one was wearing a trump tshirt and the other was wearing a blue lives matter shirt 
on sept  in el cajon california an angry mob at a black lives matter protest beat yearold trump supporter feras jabro for wearing a make america great again baseball cap the assault was broadcast live using the smartphone app periscope 
there is a move to get trump supporters to wear red on election day but in many parts of america that might just turn his supporters into easy targets lets certainly hope that we dont see the kind of violent confrontations at voting locations that many experts are anticipating 
of course there are also many on the right that are fighting mad and a hillary clinton victory under suspicious circumstances may be enough to push them over the edge 
for example this week former congressman joe walsh said that he is grabbing my musket if donald trump loses the election 
former rep joe walsh appeared to call for armed revolution wednesday if donald trump is not elected president 
walsh a former tea party congressman from illinois who is now a conservative talk radio host tweeted on november th im voting for trump on november th if trump loses im grabbing my musket you in 
and without a doubt many ordinary americans are stocking up on guns and ammunition just in case hillary clinton is victorious the following comes from usa today  
since the polls are starting to shift quite a bit towards hillary clinton ive been buying a lot more ammunition says rick darling  an engineer from harrison township in michigans detroit suburbs in a followup phone interview after being surveyed the trump supporter said he fears progressives will want to declare martial law and take our guns away after the election 
today america is more divided than i have ever seen it before and the mainstream media is constantly fueling the hatred and the anger that various groups feel toward one another 
ironically donald trump has been working very hard to bring america together in fact he is solidly on track to win a higher percentage of the black vote than any republican presidential candidate since   
if hillary clinton and the democrats win on november th things will not go well for hillary clintons political enemies the clintons used the power of the white house to go after their enemies the first time around and hillary is even more angry and more bitter now than she was back then 
and the radical left is very clear about who their enemies are this is something that i discussed on national television earlier this month  
as i write this it is difficult for me to even imagine how horrible a hillary clinton presidency would be 
but at this point that appears to be the most likely outcome  
out of all the candidates that we could have chosen the american people are about to put the most evil one by far into the white house 
perhaps donald trump can still pull off a miracle and we can avoid that fate but time is rapidly slipping away and november th will be here before we know it  ",Fake

nato and washingtons activities in eastern europe and the baltics de facto amount to permanent military presence sergei ermakov a senior analyst at the russian institute for strategic studies told rt adding that we have seen only the tip of the iceberg so far endless wargames and rotational deployments essentially amount to permanent military presence nato is testing a drastic military buildup we have witnessed the alliance deploy expeditionary forces and assault troops to eastern europe these are offensive not defensive forces what we have seen is only the tip of the iceberg ermakov said 
the north atlantic alliance has pledged to refrain from deploying substantial forces along the natorussia border on a permanent basis but has been increasingly active in the region the bloc approved its largest military buildup in eastern europe and the baltics since the end of the cold war at the  warsaw summit a development viewed with deep concern in moscow 
as part of this initiative canada germany the uk and the us will establish and lead four battle groups expected to be deployed in poland estonia latvia and lithuania each will total up to  soldiers these battalions are said to become operational in early  the alliance has justified its massive buildup by blaming russia for its ostensibly assertive behavior moscow has consistently denied these groundless claims 
ermakov further explained that forces of natos european members are not as lethal as they might seem on paper this is a force exceeding russias military potential by several times but it lacks real combat power this is why americans need to be everywhere the us was forced to boost us european commands budget he said 
earlier this year the pentagon requested bn for its operations in europe in  a fourtime increase compared to its million budget this year a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
russian officials and experts have repeatedly pointed out that nato increasing assertiveness has put regional stability at risk 
the blocs muscle flexing and aggressive rhetoric greatly reduce european security and the chances for a revival of constructive dialogue between russia and nato something russia has been calling for so many years instead the bloc is doing its best to provoke an arms race with unpredictable results peter korzun an expert on wars and conflicts wrote for the strategic culture foundation ermakov also said that the united states wants to increase its presence in the black sea region to counter russia americans can no longer count on turkey due to the failed coup attempt ankara has become a complicated partner washington is instead focusing on bulgaria and romania he said 
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg mentioned romania during a press conference held following the latest meeting of natos defense ministers he said that romanian troops will join the usled battle group in poland he also said that the ministers discussed progress made in strengthening natos presence in the black sea region in the air at sea and on land this initiative will include among other things a romanianled multinational framework brigade on land he observed providing no additional information on the subject

we have written frequently in recent weeks about a feud that erupted between chelsea clinton and doug band back in  after chelsea raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between bands firm teneo the clinton foundation and the state departmentsee here  here here and here  
the feud ultimately resulted in band being forced to draft a memo spelling out in vivid detail the many entangled relationships between himself teneo the clinton foundation and the state department fortunately todays wikileaks dump included that memo which reveals for the first time the precise financial flows between the clinton foundation bands firm teneo consulting and the clinton familys private business endeavors 
the memo starts with a brief background on teneo which was created in june  shortly after declan kelly resigned from his position as united states economic envoy to northern ireland a position to which he was appointed by secretary clinton 
in june  dk consulting was founded by declan kelley mr kelly served as coo of fti consulting until june  when he stepped down and established dk consulting at that time he also became the united states economic envoy to northern ireland  pursuant to the terms of his exit agreement with fti and consistent with the ethics agreement of his uncompensated special government employee appointment at the state department mr kelly retained and continued to provide services to three paying clients coke dow and ubs and one pro bono client allstate  in late  declan retained me as a consultant to dk consulting to help support the needs of these clients in may  mr kelly resigned his envoy position at the state department in june  mr kelly and i founded teneo strategies  simultaneously mr kelly closed dk consulting and shifted its clients to teneo 
throughout the past almost  years since president clinton left office i have sought to leverage my activities including my partner role at teneo to support and to raise funds for the foundation  this memorandum strives to set forth how i have endeavored to support the clinton foundation and president clinton personally 
in a subsequent section of the memo entitled leveraging teneo for the foundation band spells all of the donations he solicited from teneo clients for the clinton foundation in all there are roughly mm of donations listed with the largest contributors being cocacola barclays the rockefeller foundation and laureate international universities 
the donations from dow chemical are particularly notable for several reasons first because of other emails revealed by wikileaks and other foia requests we now know that dow chemical ceo andrew liveris was granted special access to then secretary clinton back in july  at the same time he was embroiled in ongoing litigation with another clinton foundation donor kuwait over a failed jointventure that would have netted dow bn in cash  as band notes in his memo  month after being granted special access to secretary clinton liveris invited president clinton and band out for a day of golf moreover shortly after his meeting with secretary clinton and golf outing with president clinton liveris decided to donate  to the clinton global initiative very convenient timing for all involved 
in august of  mr kelly invited mr liveris to play golf with president clinton and me mr kelly subsequently asked dow to become a cgi sponsor at the  level which they did  as well as making a  donation to the foundation for president clinton to attend a dow dinner in davos 
the story gets even more bizarre when band reveals in the following footnote that liveris provided the dow chemical plane to fly president clinton and his staff from new york to california and then california to north korea for their golf outing  we would assume this is a simple typo by band andor hes just geographically challengedif not this certainly raises a whole other set of questions for bill 
mr liveris provided the dow plane to fly president clinton and his staff to and from california for our trip to and from north korea  as a private trip the foundation had to pay the costs of airfare mr liveris in kind contribution saved the foundation in excess of   
according to the dialy caller  dow chemical paid teneo  million in  and  million in  for a variety of consultancy services of course bill clinton was an honorary chairman of teneo and as such was set to be paid  million for that position even though he ultimately only kept  because of the scandals that erupted around the firm including their advisory relationship with mf global 
finally band also offers the following commentary on the  million in forprofit activity he was able to secure for bill clinton as of november  as well as the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements 
independent of our fundraising and decisionmaking activities on behalf of the foundation we have dedicated ourselves to helping the president secure and engage in forprofit activities  including speeches books and advisory service engagements  in that context we have in effect served as agents lawyers managers and implementers to secure speaking business and advisory service deals in support of the presidents forprofit activity we also have solicited and obtained as appropriate inkind services for the president and his family  for personal travel hospitality vacation and the like neither justin nor i are separately compensated for these activities eg we do not receive a fee for or percentage of the more than  million in forprofit activity we have personally helped to secure for president clinton to date or the  million in future contracts should he choose to continue with those engagements with respect to business deals for his advisory services justin and i found developed and brought to president clinton multiple arrangements for him to accept or reject of his current  arrangements we secured all of them and we have helped manage and maintain all of his forprofit business relationships since  president clintons business arrangements have yielded more than  million for him personally with  million to be paid out over the next nine years should he choose to continue with the current engagements 
a big part of those forprofit activities was a mm annual payment from laureate

"end of the american dream october   
if you want to see war without end vote for hillary clinton it is tremendously ironic that hillary clinton and the mainstream media have attempted to portray donald trump as dangerous and temperamental because it is clinton that actually has a long history of being emotionally unstable 
she has a temper that is absolutely legendary and she has been cussing out the men and women in her security detail for decades  hillary clinton played a key role in starting the civil war in syria thanks to her libya is a postapocalyptic wasteland today and now she is picking a fight with the russians before she has even won the election of all the candidates there were running for president this election cycle there was nobody that was even close to as dangerous as hillary clinton and if she wins the election i am fully convinced that world war  will begin before her time in the white house is over 
someone that shares this opinion with me is donald trump according to reuters  trump recently stated that we are going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
on syrias civil war trump said clinton could drag the united states into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict 
clinton has called for the establishment of a nofly zone and safe zones on the ground to protect noncombatants some analysts fear that protecting those zones could bring the united states into direct conflict with russian fighter jets 
what we should do is focus on isis we should not be focusing on syria said trump as he dined on fried eggs and sausage at his trump national doral golf resort youre going to end up in world war three over syria if we listen to hillary clinton 
in order to have a nofly zone in syria you would have to enforce it 
and in order to enforce it you would have to be willing to shoot at the russians 
according to national intelligence director james clapper  that could have dire consequences 
russia could shoot down a us aircraft if a nofly zone were imposed over syria national intelligence director james clapper said tuesday 
i wouldnt put it past them to shoot down an american aircraft if they felt that was threatening to their forces on the ground clapper said speaking with cbs charlie rose at the council on foreign relations in new york about several national security issues 
of course clapper is not alone in that assessment the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford says that imposing a nofly zone over all of syria would require us to go to war  
right now senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war against syria and russia thats a pretty fundamental decision that certainly im not going to make  senate armed services committee september   emphasis added 
but hillary clinton is unwavering in her position that this is what she wants 
you see the truth is that hillary clinton wants to win the war that she started in syria back in  she spearheaded an effort along with saudi arabia and turkey to try to use the arab spring uprisings in the middle east as an opportunity to try to overthrow president assad in syria if it wasnt for her meddling millions of refugees would not be pouring into europe and elsewhere and there would be no humanitarian crisis in syria at all 
thanks to russian intervention the war in syria is not too far from being over but the obama administration is desperate to keep it going they understand that if assad is victorious that all of their efforts for the last five years have been wasted and that is why they are so determined to keep aleppo from falling without aleppo many of the jihadist rebels that the obama administration has been supporting wont have anywhere to hide 
so the obama administration has actually been considering direct strikes against the syrian military and the russians have already said that they will not allow this to happen  if obama is insane enough to order airstrikes against syrian forces and the russians start shooting back that could set off a chain of events that could rapidly spiral completely out of control 
one recent survey found that current american leadership has a  percent approval rating in russia right now and the russians dislike hillary clinton even more than they dislike barack obama the russians know that if hillary clinton is elected that it is quite likely that they will have to fight a war with us and that is why they desperately want donald trump to win in november you can see this outlook reflected in comments that russian president vladimir putin recently made about the two candidates  
mrs clinton has chosen to take up a very aggressive stance against our country against russia mr trump on the other hand calls for cooperation  at least when it comes to the international fight against terrorism putin said 
naturally we welcome those who would like to cooperate with us and we consider it wrong that we always have to be in conflict with one another creating existential threats for each other and for the whole world putin noted 
anyone that watched the three presidential debates could see that hillary clinton is absolutely seething with animosity for russia the thought of her finger on the nuclear trigger is almost too terrible to contemplate but it may soon become a reality 
and even now the obama administration and our nato allies are shifting forces into position for a confrontation with moscow this week it is being reported that nato troops will soon be sent to poland estonia latvia and lithuania  nine hundred us troops are to be sent to eastern europe next year as americas troubled relationship with russia enters new uncertain territory a usled battle group of nato allied soldiers will be sent to poland as part of the multination operation british forces will lead one of the four battle groups in estonia canada will spearhead the presence in latvia and germany will be present in lithuania 
in addition infowars is reporting that us marines will soon be stationed in norway near the border with russia 
after accepting a pentagon proposal norway will host us marines at a base near the russian border as russia deploys nuclearcapable ships to kaliningrad 
a rotating force of approximately  marines will be stationed at an airfield in the city of vaernes just outside trondheim beginning in january norway and russia share an mile border in the arctic 
the us initiative to augment their training and exercises in norway by locating a marine corps rotational force in norway is highly welcome and will have positive implications for our already strong bilateral relationship said norwegian defense minister ine eriksen sÃ¸reide 
most americans arent aware of any of this nor do they really care about our relationship with russia 
but in russia things are completely different the possibility of war with the united states is the biggest news story over there these days  and feverish preparations are being made for a potential nuclear confrontation  
russian authorities have stepped up nuclearwar survival measures amid a showdown with washington dusting off sovietera civildefense plans and upgrading bomb shelters in the biggest cities 
at the kremlins ministry of emergency situations the cold war is back 
the country recently held its biggest civil defense drills since the collapse of the ussr with what officials said were  million people rehearsing a response to chemical and nuclear threats 
i know that i have been writing about this over and over  but the truth is that we are on a path to war with russia and the election of hillary clinton would greatly accelerate the march toward war 
in my controversial new book  i expressed my belief that war with russia is coming but at the time that i wrote it i didnt know how the election would turn out 
at this point it looks like clinton is very likely to win on november th and that would be absolutely disastrous for our relationship with russia 
if you are reading this and you are considering voting for hillary clinton please dont do it  we simply cannot afford to have an emotionally unstable warmonger with a violent temper in the white house at this critical time 
if the american people do choose hillary clinton this november i believe that it will be a choice that they will bitterly bitterly regret in future years this article was posted thursday october   at  am share this article",Fake

sometimes a thin layer of crust accumulates on the surface of the ocean mostly made up of fecal matter and trash its where environmentalists come from 
they are effectively the pits also environmentalists hate people see top  environmentalists who openly support killing off humans  a side effect of being sad soggy little bottom dwellers so its no surprise they want to kill off coal mines in montana  despite the fact that said coal mines are pillars which help support the economy and the towns well being also electric cars  but whatever 
the  residents in southeast montana face an uphill battle to keep the city alive against an onslaught of legal battles and a major anticoal crusade launched by outsiders 
an out of court agreement was reached to close two of the four units of colstrips coalfired power plant by  the sierra club and the montana environmental information center which sued the plant see the closure as a victory 
plant operators came to an agreement with activists because oregon democratic gov signed legislation mandating the state be coalfree by  
consequences 
its a win for everybody except the people employed by the coal plant also colstrips entire economy coal plant workers make money then spend that money at other businesses except now all those lads will be jobless which means they wont be spending money or helping to boost the economy as much anymore which means other businesses will suffer thanks environmentalists 
by the way green earth sjws tend to also be fans of the indians  the people not the baseball team racist that wee tidbit is worth noting considering how their ecofriendly plan isnt very nativefriendly 
you lose two of those units and you are shutting down half the town small said this closure will have an economic impact on the reservations throughout the county and across the state small is of north cheyenne descent hes made an extra effort to recruit american indian students nearly three dozen northern cheyenne work at the colstrip plant and three times that figure work in the coal fields 
a double header bad for the economy bad for the indigenous people 
as mentioned above the coal plant never stood a chance thanks to impending regulations the plant has long seen the end drawing near possibly because they would rather close indefinitely in order to be spared from ever having to hear another squawking lobbyist attempt to talk them into seeing things their way whatever the reason environmentalists and the state teamed up to bully the coal plant into shutting down now the future of an entire town lies in jeopardy

grinnell college is promoting a guide to help students avoid cultural appropriation this halloween warning that some costumes could be considered deplorable and problematic 
the guide provides several examples of costumes that might fit the definition of cultural appropriation defining the term as the act of displaying peoples cultures in a disrespectful or condescending manner 
the guide called my identity not your costume goes on to list several examples of offensive halloween costumes featuring pictures of grinnell students holding photos of costumes that would be considered disrespectful towards their culture 
in one instance the guide shows a picture of a burly white man dressed in lingerie with a sash proclaiming call me caitlyn referring to caitlyn jenner the photo is held by a grinnell student wearing a national coming out day pin and includes a caption stating the misrepresentation of my identity bothers me because people categorize me by my looks and may not understand my culture 
another example of culturally appropriated halloween costumes according to the guide is using other cultures as accessories to appear more hipinteresting without adequate understanding or permission one example of which is a picture of someone dressed as a hindu deity being held by an indian student and the message that such costumes are deplorable and problematic 
it then warns students that if their costumes take defining characteristics of another culture without permission or understanding of the historical background behind the said culture then these costumes might be too offensive to wear 
the guide then concludes with two questions the school thinks students should consider before selecting a halloween costume asking does your costume perpetuate stereotypes or inaccurately portray my culture as a joke as well as why would i find your halloween costume to be offensive

"liberty blitzkrieg october   
the name peter kadzik probably doesnt ring a bell for many of you although it probably should this guy is a real piece of work as an excellent article published earlier today at the daily caller demonstrates 
heres some of what we learned 
the day after hillary clinton testified in front of the house select committee on benghazi last october john podesta the democrats campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of wellconnected friends including peter kadzik a top official at the justice department 
the dinner arrangement revealed in hacked podesta emails released by wikileaks is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of states email practices 
podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server says matthew whitaker the executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust a government watchdog group 
kadzik who started at the doj in  helped spearhead the effort to nominate lynch who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president 
kadzik represented podesta during the monica lewinsky investigation and in the waning days of the bill clinton administration kadzik lobbied podesta on behalf of marc rich the fugitive who bill clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office 
in a sept  email  which the washington free beacon flagged last week podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign 
podesta who would later head up the obama white house transition effort wrote that kadzik was a fantastic lawyer who kept me out of jail 
podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by independent counsel kenneth starr for the investigation but he defended the falsehoods saying later that he was merely relaying false information from clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time 
he did lie to me podesta said about clinton in a national public radio interview in  clinton was acquitted by the senate in feb  of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the lewinsky probe 
kadzik then a lawyer with the firm dickstein shapiro morin  oshinsky represented podesta through the fiasco 
podesta had been promoted to clintons chief of staff when he and kadzik became embroiled in another scandal 
kadzik was then representing marc rich a billionaire financier who was wanted by the us government for evading a  million tax bill the fugitive who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism had been living in switzerland for  years when he sought the pardon 
to help rich kadzik lobbied podesta heavily in the weeks before clinton left office on jan   
a house oversight committee report released in may  stated that kadzik was recruited into marc richs lobbying campaign because he was a longtime friend of white house chief of staff john podesta 
the report noted that kadzik contacted podesta at least seven times regarding richs pardon 
on top of the allhandsondeck lobbying effort richs exwife denise rich had doled out more than  million to the clintons and other democrats prior to the pardon she gave  to hillary clintons new york senate campaign and another  to the clinton presidential library 
the first mention of personal contact between podesta and kadzik in the wikileaks dump is in an oct   email sent out by vincent roberti a lobbyist who is close to podesta and his superlobbyist brother tony podesta in it roberti refers to a dinner reservation at posto a washington dc restaurant 
the dinner was set for  that evening just a day after clinton gave  hours of testimony to the benghazi committee 
podesta and kadzik met several months later for dinner at podestas home another email shows  and in an email sent on may   kadziks son asked podesta for a job on the clinton campaign 
ill have the lobster risotto with a side of cronyism and middle class destruction 
as head of the office of legislative affairs kadzik handles inquiries from congress on a variety of issues in that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the clinton investigation 
the justice department and fbi have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation which concluded in july with no charges filed against clinton 
but kadzik worked on other clinton email issues in his dealings with congress 
last november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation 
seems like a pretty important decision for a clinton crony to make 
the justice department declined to comment on the record for this article 
could the department of injustice have any less credibility

as infowars has highlighted  there have already been numerous reports of early voters in texas seeing their ballots flipped from donald trump to hillary clinton a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
while election officials have dismissed the reports suggesting user error is to blame tech experts have long warned that the machines can become less accurate over time 
larry norden a voting technology expert told npr that the reports usually arise where outdated technology is being employed 
over time as people vote that calibration becomes less and less accurate norden noted 
during elections over the past decade and more there have been reports of voting machines flipping indeed the reports were so widespread that even entertainment shows such as the simpsons drew attention to it 
meanwhile the washington post has admitted that the press is engaging in voter suppression bizarrely claiming it is a legitimate way of countering trumps rigged election claims 
callum borchers author at the washington post blog the fix writes since the final presidential debate last week many news outlets have been delivering an unvarnished message to donald trump supporters your candidate is virtually certain to lose the election nov  a day later the timess upshot blog increased clintons chances of winning to  percent  an alltime high on monday politicos ben schreckinger wrote that  donald trumps path to an election night win is almost entirely closed  here at the fix chris cillizza and aaron blake wrote that  donald trumps chances of winning are approaching zero  these are accurate statistically sound statements but they are something else too declarations that trump is highly unlikely to win also serve as counters to the republican nominees warning that the rigged election could be  stolen from us  
the latest polls which trump insists are rigged due to oversampling show clinton with a double digit lead 
however hillary clintons campaign manager robby mook has warned that trumps suggestions that the polls are wrong and he can still win are absolutely right

on wednesdays morning joe  cohost joe scarborough once again was forced to actually tell the truth about the liberal bias in media coverage throughout this entire election 
scarborough a former florida republican congressman began the discussion stating that 
as a republican theres a natural reaction to press bias and it has been so overwhelming even if it is has been earned the media has taken sides theyve aggressively taken sides and theyve admitted that were aggressively taking sides and i think you get some republicans that see that every four years its so funny they do that every four years every four years its like the end of the world if a republican gets elected president because theyre all racist its the boy that cried wolf 
in a sense what was articulated is that the mass medias historic liberal bias against conservatives is reflected in every election so much so that in this one their usual partisan attacks against trumps controversial personality are not as effective also scarborough stated the fact shared by many conservatives that there is an overwhelming and aggressive agenda by the press to defend liberals 
furthermore in conversation with frequent panelist mike barnicle scarborough added also its such a confounding election where we go back and forth on what its about mike barnicle said all along that its about hillary clinton people say im going to vote for hillary clinton as a protest against and then after sitting on that for a couple of weeks that thought for a couple weeks they go ehmaybe not 
in a way they were all trying to explain how trump is still almost tied to clinton in a number of battleground state polls despite the disproportionate amount of negative coverage later on in response to cohost willie geists remarks about the race being almost over scarborough proved his earlier point about the medias disconnect 
i got to say willie everybody that is saying its over and youre a fool if youre suggesting that the american people may have the final say at the voting booth are the same people that were saying in august september october november december january february that there was no way in a million years that donald trump would ever win the republican nomination stating it just as emphatically as theyre stating now that we need to avert our eyes this race is over

cnn commentator angela rye on wednesday blamed the failure of republicans to repeal and replace obamacare for the newly announced doubledigit premium increases in the presidents signature health care law 
its not just hillary clinton that needs to tackle this but also congress rye said on cnns new day the reason we are in the position that we are in right now frankly alisyn is because republicans fell short of their promise to repeal which is what they said they wanted to do and replace 
host alisyn camerota stopped rye before she got any further and reminded her that president obama had promised premiums would go down 
most states will see health care premiums under the affordable care act increase by an average of  percent according to data released this week by the obama administration indiana will see its rates slightly go down but other states like arizona will see costs skyrocket by  percent members of the administration have been quick to soften the blow of the increase by reminding people that a majority of those on the obamacare exchanges would be receiving tax credits to help pay for the now more expensive health insurance plans   ",Fake

local authorities in calais claim that the jungle refugee camp has been successfully evacuated but according to an rt crew at the site a number of refugees and migrants apparently remain at the halfdemolished camp 
unlike the previous days and nights the demolition of the site on wednesday for the most part passed off peacefully 
this is the end of the jungle calais regional prefect fabienne buccio reported mission accomplished 
the statement may be as premature as the one made in the same words by then us president george w bush after the iraq invasion in  rts crew on the ground reports that dozens of people remain at the camp 
soon after that statement was made we went inside and saw that there was either a massive blunder in terms of their public relations line or a lie the camp was far from being evacuated and closed rts harry fear reported from the scene

the number of wild animals on earth could fall by more than twothirds in the  years to  according to a new report which places the blame on the destruction of habitats hunting and pollution the forecast could lead to major consequences for humans 
the living planet report  says that animal losses are on track to reach  percent in the  years to  the reports authors also took into consideration a recent trend in animal population decline citing a  percent plummet between  and  
the researchers analyzed the changing presence of  monitored populations of the  vertebrate species  mammals birds fish amphibians and reptiles among them 
according to the paper the biggest cause of the plummeting animal populations is the destruction of wilderness areas by farming and logging pollution was also mentioned as a significant problem vaccineladen mms to be distributed via drone for endangered ferrets httpstcowmduucnxn pictwittercomafxrag 
humanitys misuse of natural resources is threatening habitats pushing irreplaceable species to the brink and threatening the stability of our climate said wwfs director of science mike barrett a d v e r t i s e m e n t 
animals across the planet are expected to be affected however rivers and lakes are the hardesthit areas barrett noted that global warming is exacerbating the pressures 
we are no longer a small world on a big planet we are now a big world on a small planet where we have reached a saturation point the stockholm resilience centers professor johan rockstrÃ¶m said in a foreword for the report 
the decline in wildlife along with climate change is part of the proposed notion of anthropocene a term which suggests a new era in which humans have managed to have a significant global impact on earths geology and ecosystems 
the notion  which has yet to be officially approved as a term used to explain geological time  can lead to major consequences 
the richness and diversity of life on earth is fundamental to the complex life systems that underpin it life supports life itself and we are part of the same equation lose biodiversity and the natural world and the life support systems as we know them today will collapse wwf directorgeneral marco lambertini said as quoted by the guardian 
in fact the report states that humans could be anything but happy if the forecast comes to fruition noting that the predicted situation could provoke serious competition 
increased human pressure threatens the natural resources that humanity depends upon increasing the risk of water and food insecurity and competition over natural resources the report states 
there does however appear to be some hope some species are beginning to recover suggesting that conservation efforts could help tackle the crisis 
however barrett noted that in order for such efforts to take place society must largely change how it consumes resources 
youd like to think that was a nobrainer in that if a business is consuming the raw materials for its products in a way that is not sustainable then inevitably it will eventually put itself out of business barrett said 
the report is certainly a pretty shocking snapshot of where we are he added my hope though is that we dont throw our hands up in despair  there is no time for despair we have to crack on and act i do remain convinced we can find our sustainable course through the anthropocene but the will has to be there to do it 
the new report comes less than two months after a similar analysis found that earth has lost onetenth of its wilderness sites since the early s   ",Fake

"record numbers say no to proposed handgun ban 
steve   
a new poll released by gallup has found that a record amount of americans are opposed to gun control measures  
the survey found that  percent of respondents over three quarters believe that a ban on civilian ownership of handguns should not be made law 
the findings represent a fourpoint increase on the same survey from last year in addition to an alltime high for the past three decades 
the poll also found that almost two thirds  percent are against a ban on semiautomatic rifles or assault weaponsas the corporate media refers to them 
that figure represents a full tenpoint increase on previous findings and is an all time record high since polling began on the issue  years ago 
just  percent less than a third say they support a ban on handgun ownership while only  percent support a semiautomatic ban an eightpoint decline on previous findings 
in addition gun sales have been hitting record highs for months on end 
in a summary of the new poll gallup seemed surprised by the findings describing waning support for a gun ban as a paradox 
perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in highprofile incidents including the terrorist attacks in san bernardino california and orlando and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and newtown connecticut 
the findings reveal just how out of step hillary clintons position on gun control is with the majority of americans 
hillary is a staunch gun control proponent wikileaks releases have revealed that hillary plans to implement strict gun control measures by executive order

france and denmark will also commit more troops

unconstitutional secret government operations if these activities are so illegal why are people not coming forward to report themover the last fifty years us government intelligence agencies have perfected a complex sequential system to systematically silence or destroy any employee including his or her family who attempts to reveal illegal or unconstitutional activities conducted as part of secret government operationsas a condition of employment military and intelligence employees recruited for secret operations are required to sign a secrecy agreement or nondisclosure agreement before being given access to the position which offers high pay and status in the organization this agreement threatens civil and criminal penalties if the employee reveals any information regarding the program thinking the agreement will only be used for legal purposes and will get them the coveted job all employees eagerly sign itthis secrecy agreement was originally designed to protect legitimate classified information to protect military personnel during wartime and protect legitimate national defense information and technologyhowever because of the binding power of the agreement government agencies began using it as a powerful tool to silence federal employees who question the legality of certain government operations it was the perfect tool to threaten silence or jail any whistle blower who dared to challenge the secret operations of governmenttoday the secrecy agreement is routinely used as an efficient weapon to intimidate or silence employees annual refresher briefings are given to remind employees of the penalties for violating the agreement these penalties include huge fines termination financial ruin and even prison  all of which mean the destruction of their lives and their families most will not reveal any wrongdoing no matter how egregious for fear of calculated severe retributionwhen employees sign the secrecy agreement and are cleared for classified programs they are not told they are giving up their right to a jury trial or to sue the agency that hired them if they try to do so as a whistle blower they find they have no right to be heard in federal court many have found this out when their case was denied then it was too late that is part of the systemif the employee attempts to contact their congressman or senator their representative is blocked from receiving any information about their case because they do not have the necessary clearancewhen the employee attempts to blow the whistle to the congressional intelligence committees their response is ignored it is made clear to committee members that they are not to touch such cases so they refer them back to their senator or congressman who cannot access information involved in their caseif a courageous employee continues to proceed and blow the whistle a system of personal and career destruction follows this begins with promotions being denied being turned down for sensitive or career enhancing assignments and their files being flagged ruining their reputation inside their agency at this point their career is over if they go quietly the retribution stopswhen the employee still continues their effort to report the information their travel records personnel records medical records and security records are searched for mistakes or damaging information that can be used to threaten them with termination their telephones and computers are monitored searching for incriminating information if no substantive information can be found it is fabricated and placed in their fileemployees who refuse to back down are then subjected to internal security investigations multiple hostile interviews attempting to get them to recant their information and multiple polygraph interrogationsin many cases the employee is commanded to report to the internal medical office for psychological evaluation if they comply the evaluation labels them as paranoid unstable or disgruntled this information is placed in their file and is used later to justify the agencys action in the event of outside scrutinyif the employee contacts a member of the news media they are immediately cited with violating their secrecy agreement and criminal penalties are filed against them several news media outlets are connected to the cia and nsa and notify them of the employees contactfinally the employee is forced to resign after being threatened with termination in kangaroo court meetings where the information fabricated in their files is used against themafter termination or forced resignation interest rates on their internal credit union loans are raised to make the payments unaffordable the release of the employees retirement funds needed provide for their family are blocked a felony the agency black lists them from gaining employment with other government agencies or contractors further ruining them financiallydehumanized financially ruined and under severe emotional and mental pressure the employees family begins to break apart if the familys foundation is not strong this results in alcoholism depression and divorce in some cases it has resulted in the employee committing suicide the ultimate goal of the program of destruction this silences the employee permanently obscuring the agencys role in their destruction it is the perfect crimeshould the employee still have the resolve to endure this program of career and personal destruction and continues to press for release of the information or if his family members attempt to sue the agency for the illegal activity classified agencies will invoke the secretive state secrets privilege which orders the employee and his family not to reveal the information or face prison if the familys case reaches federal court the state secrets privilege is invoked and the case is shut down  and sealed federal judges rubber stamp the censoring of the case without reviewing the case factsnow that the employees case and in some cases their familys case is shut down and under seal citing national security the process of silencing the employee is complete many are never heard from again fearing prison if they talk to anyone including an attorneyusing attractive awards of multimillion dollar contracts the us government military industrial complex convinces private corporations that their employees must be cleared and sign secrecy agreements this includes employees at all levels from secretaries to ceos once they have signed the secrecy agreement they are bound to keep all information including potentially illegal information quiet being threatened with the same penaltiesto date over five million americans have been required to sign this secrecy agreement and now fall under the shadow of the state secrets privilegeonly a few federal employees have made it through this systematic process of destruction to reveal what they know about the illegal operation they observed sadly some whistle blowers have died mysterious deaths or committed suicideemployees in intelligence agencies are aware of penalties contained in the secrecy agreement and the huge risk in violating it even to expose corruption most look the other way to protect their careers retirements and families many have observed the outward signs of the system of personal and career destruction used on others and a culture of fear exists but they are not fully aware of all that is being done the full scope of the system is only known at the higher levels of the organization and is hidden from employees until its use is necessarythis is why we do not see whistle blowers coming out and reporting what they have seen this system has been used and perfected for over fifty years it is being used because it worksit works unless the system is exposed the whistle blower knows what is coming and prepares for it and they are supported by private organizations and individuals dedicated to truth in

the nras admission that a president cant confiscate guns because congress writes the laws not the president also demonstrates the implausibility of repeated recent claims from the nra that link hillary clinton to gun confiscation

the article quoted obama as telling the questioner im about to leave office there have been more guns sold since ive been president than just about any time in us history there are enough guns for every man woman and child in this country and at no point have i ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners so it is just not true

rhude didnt sit down after asking his question rather he stood silently as president obama didnt even try to answer his question but instead went off on a defensive tirade first of all the notion that i or hillary or democrats or whoever you want to choose are hellbent on taking away folks guns is just not true and i dont care how many times the nra says it

the technique of  criticism and selfcriticism  kritika i samokritika was developed during the early days of the soviet union  this got results when the early soviet show trials and purges took place the targets would confess to committing treasonthe details stretching credulityand beg for execution the maoists chinese communists used it too typically during  struggle sessions  also forced confessions were required in vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps 
what happened wasnt much different from a medieval inquisition those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did of course physical forms of coercion were also an option these werent actual trials their fates were already decided
the lucky ones were released and got to resume their lives as before after their memorable reminder to toe the party line others faced stiffer penalties than that from loss of party membership and accompanying status all the way up to execution no amount of compliance or abject groveling could save them if it was predetermined that they were going to be purged or killed
after the ordeal survivors were surely scared witless with their egos beaten down they were ready to do as they were told without question its basically a form of brainwashing as for those who were executed after that the purpose of going through the motions was for benefit of the audience it was political theater convincing those present that they were delivering justice to wrongdoers and serving as an example of what could happen to those who step out of line
other than that the criticism and selfcriticism techniquebadgering and forcing a confessionalso was picked up in the usa during the s by certain cults and oddball encounter groups today we might think of these strange and humiliating rituals as a thing of the past but the truth is that theyve merely changed form  as ive noted previously  cultural marxism is a crappy and inherently destructive forexport variety of communism so its no great surprise that it has adapted this technique for its purposes
modern witch hunts this is what happens to people who say that bruce jenner is actually a dude
when people are encouraged to become incensed over even tiny things  this causes a walking on eggshells atmosphere in todays politically correct climate its easy to run afoul of the thought police this might result in a visit to the hr department or a campus speech code investigation however if the thoughtcrime is serious enoughor the target is prominent enoughthen this can ignite a media circus  also someone could end up featured on a mailing list for social justice warriors  besides just trolling and harassment this can result in doxxing release of your personal information or pressure on an employer to fire the thought criminal
we in the western world pride ourselves on the right to free speech that was one of the main goals of liberalism back in the th century when liberalism was still a good thing actually many free countries criminalize politically incorrect speech even in places that dont have legal penalties for speaking your mind it carries the risk of the loss of your livelihood  this effectively makes entire policy arguments forbidden to articulate which naturally is the whole point other goals of course are information control and thus thought control so much for freedom of speech it took a few centuries but liberals now oppose what they once stood for
the following scenario has happened time and again someone points out an inconvenient truth  writes something that offends someone donates to the wrong cause mocks a feminists first world problems  tells an offcolor joke  or even wears the wrong tshirt  then the feeding frenzy begins resulting in torrents of criticism usually the target apologizes profusely but loses his job no matter how abject or groveling his apologies are
its possible to convince a judge and twelve jurors that youre not guilty of something but good luck getting the media or an online sjw mob to calm down and leave you alone the traditional communist session was better in one way that is they quit after breaking the targets will a modern feeding frenzy though can drag on for months even after the target has been begging for forgiveness what goes on the internet can stay there forever including lies about you
if you get caught in a social justice weenie witch hunt  never apologize explain and clarify if you absolutely must this is for the benefit of the uncommitted the sjws will already have made up their small minds about you and wont stop no matter what you do never let them break your frame instead go on the attack you have a right to your own opinion and to express it
if you beg for their forgiveness then you will be allowing them to turn their criticism into your selfcriticism remember that groveling is unlikely to save you apologies are for people who actually did something wrong having a difference of opinion isnt wrong despite some peoples curious notions about freedom of speech
here are some other particulars to remember
you cant reason with them  online mobs dont know you and have been told that youre an evildoer youll probably never know exactly what was said about you who said it and what email list all that was on if you do find out sue for defamation of character however you can be sure that youve already been deemed guilty theyre not interested in the truth sjws have great difficulty comprehending basic logic many of them dont even believe in objective reality  only their feelings are real to them why would the truth matter to these idiots finally social justice weenies are a bunch of losers  their opinion of you matters less than that of a snotty child cursing you out therefore dont let these oxygenwasters mess with your selfesteem societal criticism and selfcriticism wallowing in guilt at its finest
the frankfurt school  a communist think tank that moved to the usa and began subverting the educational system developed critical theory  one of their top classics was eros and civilization by herbert marcuse it contained lots of freudian arguments on how our society was too repressed and we needed to loosen up our morals another was the authoritarian personality by theodor adorno that too contained freudian mumbojumbo smearing right wing politics with accusations of neurosis and homo daddy issues all told they wrote dozens of books along those lines some attacking western civilization directly these vaporings wouldnt have amounted to much if they hadnt become trendy in academia and influenced the s zeitgeist
meanwhile radical feminismthe second wavewas starting up this too had lots of communist influence  another front of cultural marxism this also was all about criticism of our culture this caused friction between the sexes driving a wedge deep into the heart of society the results included the snarky snotty and spoiled attitudes youve surely encountered worse this caused untold misery from high divorce rates and broken homes 
this was one of several movements that became prominent during the s and are still with us today surely you can think of many others the methodology was the sameall angrily made overblown complaints about how bad society has been to them the way they tell it theyre out fighting for their rights the goal of cultural marxism though was all about attacking our morale and softening us up the people involved in those movements were merely tools being used by leaders who were in it for power money and status
the educational system has been dumbed down  history has been rewritten too figures like christopher columbus and the us founding fathers are bad guys now even as early as the s campuses were hellbent in purging dwems their charming term for dead white european males from the literary canon none of this was really about inclusiveness its all about robbing our people of our heritage making us ashamed of our accomplishments and destroying our resolve
the propaganda is everywhere television is full of social and political messages even in shows for children  and piggybacked onto advertisements too sensitivity training courses deliver politically correct indoctrination college campuses are notorious for pushing propaganda this even happens to elementary school kids my first exposure was in second grade some of the indoctrination exercises require audience participation such as forcing them to fill out privilege checklists with the facts cherrypicked  to instill a sense of collective guilt
all this has worked according to plan many are out of touch with their roots and dont understand that they have a heritage worth preserving worse others have been infected by guilt trips sometimes this leads to public spectacles of wallowing in guilt again theres the selfcriticism part
the antidote to this is the truth the fact is every civilization has its good points and its bad points and ours is no exception its rotten hypocrisy for the bullshit merchants in academia and the media to dwell on our faults and overlook those of other parts of the world while selectively ignoring our accomplishments and elevating those of others  the truth is that none of our shortcomings or misdeeds are solely found in western civilization but some of our good characteristics are indeed unique
you can protect your children by home schooling them or sending them to a private school where they wont be indoctrinated you can always get rid of your tv too meanwhile though millions of other students will be putty in the hands of propagandizing professors and teachers and of course the lying media those pushing this from the top down must be called out exposed and removed from power

"at the third debate donald trump was asked if he would accept the results of the election trump responded that he would have to look at the process to determine if everything was done fairly before he could accept it the media went berserk claiming that trump was undermining democracy but is the us system really rigged and if it is can trump overcome it
why rig the system the elite realize that their time is short
woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time revelation 
it is human nature to want to accumulate wealth it is also human nature to want to keep what you have one of the ways that the wealthy do that is through influencing the political process to ensure it is favorable to them a democratic republic is particularly easy to influence the wealthy elite can buy candidates through donations to them or to their superpacs they can make voting patterns more favorable to them by changing the countrys demographics or they can influence voters through the supposedly unbiased news media that they control in the us the wealthy elite use every one of these levers to rig the system
for example liberal voters often favor a progressive tax system where high earners pay greater percentages than those who earn less it sounds like a populist policy but it is not progressive taxation is put in place to prevent middle class people from rising into the ranks of the truly wealthy who have already accumulated their wealth and are taxed at the much lower capital gains rate progressive taxation keeps the rich on top and keeps the plebs down thats why no matter which political party is in power we are still stuck with progressive taxation
everything goes well as long as both parties dont rock the boat but once you get a true wildcard like trump the system must spring into action to stop the threat to the established order thats what we are seeing now the elite are using every tool in the arsenal of the rigged system to ensure trump does not upset their gravy train the elite sense their time is short
voter fraud 
the first way in which the election is rigged is through voter fraud in his gettysburg address trump outlined some of the ways in which this occurs
according to pew there are  million voter registrations that in the us that are either invalid or significantly inaccurate  million dead people are registered to vote and some of them are voting i wonder how that happens  million people are registered to vote in more than one state these are numbers folks these are numbers  of noncitizens are registered to vote
liberals always object to any sort of voter identification requirement they say that it negatively affects minority voters who may not have any identification but this is obvious nonsense the real reason liberals oppose voter identification is because it would make voter fraud more difficult
by raising concerns about voter fraud trump is firing a warning shot he is saying that he will fight voter fraud unlike prior gop candidates who preferred defeat to calling out cheating by the other side simply putting the democrats on notice may cause them to cheat less than they would have otherwise the only question is whether trump will be able to muster enough votes to overcome the amount of cheating that will take place
the lÃ¼genpresse 
a second way that the system is rigged is through the legacy news media these include the three oldest television news networks abc cbs nbc as well as the newer ones cnn msnbc fox it also includes the remaining newspapers especially the new york times washington post and the wall street journal of these the only ones that are reliably conservative are fox and the wsj both of which are owned by rupert murdock but even here it is more accurate to call fox and the wsj neoliberal rather than conservative as they both push the globalist message of open borders and unenforced trade
trump is very media savvy hes been in the public eye since the s and his philosophy has been that no publicity is bad publicity trump has used this to highlight his policies by making controversial statements he has been able to force the media to cover his positions still the nonstop smear campaign has hurt trumps numbers particularly among older voters who still get their news from legacy sources
new media outlets like return of kings breitbart and danger  play have been more favorable to trump but the most highly funded new media such as daily beast heat street buzzfeed and huffington post all push the globalist message the end result that trump is fighting an ocean of disinformation with only a handful of allies by his side
voter discouragement fivethirtyeight doing its best to discourage trump voters
another way that that system is rigged is that the legacy media conspires to discourage trump voters from going to the polls one way they do this is to over poll democrats to make it look like trump is losing for example one recent poll placed hillary  points higher than trump but even obama was only able to beat mccain by  points even though he was packing stadiums of  people and hillary doesnt command the sort of adulation that obama did in 
there is a huge motivation gap between trump and clinton recently trump held a rally in tampa where  people showed up some of these people waited in line for  hours for the chance to see trump a day later hillary hosted a rally in florida where only  people showed up and some of those were likely paid plants her running mate tim kaine did even worse barely getting  people to show up for one of his events
one day before the brexit vote polls showed remain leading by  points leave ended up winning by  points
why does the legacy media report polls that show trump losing by a landslide because it is designed to dishearten trump voters
conclusion will trump be able to overcome the rigged system it will be a heroic achievement if he does one thing is certain this is not the time to give up but to fight with all of our might the elites want us to be discouraged to give up hope to lie down and die that is the one thing we will never do even if the host of hell rise up to oppose you go to the ballot box on november th regardless of what you may hear otherwise your life will be very different under president trump than it will be under globalist pawn hillary
win or lose our battle to bring back the patriarchy will not end on november  th  a trump victory would give us breathing room to start restoring our society in the open a hillary victory heaven forbid would signal that our work will need to be underground either way our battle is just beginning in future columns i will outline the way forward for traditional men

"last week i expounded the idea that we should take the time to ponder about emotions  these matter much in prompting us to take action or not to to think about something or not to sustained emotional states can lead us to pedestalize girls ignore our own needs or refraining from caring about our own interests whereas others push theirs every day they can also allow said girls to go shamelessly after shortterm pleasure or be complacent to rapefugees while shrieking and fingerwaving against men of their own kin
pondering passions and emotions does not mean getting led by them at the expense of critical thinking rather it is the exact opposite as it allows us to spot the shrewd ones who want to push our emotional buttons as well as being freer to take more thoughtful and actually less emotiondetermined actions once we have gained awareness of passions we can decide which ones we want to stimulate and why
following this idea i made some suggestions of how and in whom we could stir positive emotions such empathy hope and love today i will do the same with four other passions or emotions admiration shame humility and fear
 admiration 
society i think should admit some victimhood to those who were raised as weaklings or acted cluelessly out of good intentions women in particular should be more empathetic and nurturing towards nice and beta malesas long as their empathy does not extent out of admitted boundarieshence taking an opposite direction from the egotistical uncaring orientation a lot of them currently harbor of course this should not equate to validating too much the unhealthy unmanly men women should also be trained into validating more manlier men and here admiration comes into play
as nassim taleb put it we are living more and more in an extremistan where those at the highest level take the lions share while the resources diminish quickly down the ladder girls today tend to admire only the most famous or highstatus people which leads them to despise the ninetynine per cent this exasperated hypergamy should be tamed so that the average man as long as he achieves the minimum andor is upstanding and dutiful gets his fair share a more democratic but still conditional distribution of girls admiration would reward actual good behaviour for men and decrease the intramasculine competition 
girls should also admireand not mockproper feminine role models upstanding mothers females taking proper care of themselves and so on ought to be at least esteemed by the average girl
 shame 
shame arises from measuring our actions against moral standards and discovering that they fall short if our actions fall short and we fail to notice we can be shamed or made to notice shame is normally accentuated if its object is exposed but unlike embarrassment also attaches to a thought or action that remains undisclosed and undiscoverable to others neel burton heaven and hell  chap p
a particularly strong emotion shame usually comes as a blow makes one lose face or composure to eventually feel guilt or remorse just like other strong emotions it has been used with consumed malignancy by the left
leftists created a narrative where whites are held entirely responsible for dreadful historical phenomena such as slavery the holocaust an oppression of minority groups or racism as these phenomena are constantly talked about and expanded whites are also supposed to feel a correspondingly boundless guilt the sheer power of guilt can explain why so many whites have been afraid to stand up being shamed as a racist or nazi can be enough to endure rejection from ones family lose reputation and employment
shame can be aroused through two levers the standards one agrees with and ones purported responsibility both levers have been skillfully used to un shame the liberalfavored groups as for the standards feminists attacked what they called slutshaming while also shaming relentlessly manly behavior and as for the responsibility pretty much all those who claim to identify with a minority tend to deny all by slipping it over the majoritys shoulders
this is how you get persistent offenders or jihadi families expressing neither shame nor remorse whereas the productive working and normally sociable person gets nagged for being white in the current year better be a true rapist who can evade responsibility and shame by invading europe than a young virgin of european descent
what we should do here sounds pretty obvious in theory though it will be much harder to carry on in practice as people evidently hate being shamed especially when they have been accustomed of blaming everything on the others
shame the fatties  shame the arrogant snowflakes whose unwillingness to respect is all too obvious recall the selfdetermination of antiwhite liberals and criminals they all made free choices they should carry all associated responsibility
as for us we must keep our face straight never make clueless concessions to skillful framers or hysterical sjws if they appeal to moral standards put forth your own as legitimate if they appeal to your purported actions or responsibility emphasize theirsand how it cannot be boiled down to external factors
even dogs and cats are considered responsible by their caretakers so they can be punished for bad behaviours and learn likewise granting certain people or groups a constant deresponsabilization amounts to give them a free pass for destroying everything criminals of said groups have agency and the liberals who gave them a pass to plunder and kill whitey are responsible as well
shame can also arise from being associated with something or someone deemed as despicable the liberal policy of distinguishing sharply between terrorists and documented aliens in spite of how much the latter to house the former allows for the latter going without shame even when they are closely associated with terroristswhereas every white is threatened with shame if he has a ist or phobic acquaintance
turn the table shake off the burden from the disenfranchised majority and put it back on those who have been acting with impunity for too long
 humility 
current year girls overinflated ego is enough notwithstanding economic or racial factors to explain a host of social problems blinded by it girls ignore how much they are determined by their own cravings shortterm desires or by the latest fashions around they drink loads of booze fuck with random strangers reframe their story as a rape later so they can blame it all on the guy  they never learn to cook clean take care of something else than their instagram account and corporate career speaking of corporate isnt it striking that so many men are badly in need of employment sex and have almost nothing whereas spoiled corporate drones believe they can havetakeit all
ego makes one lose any sense of proportion or balance it leads to complacency merciless exploitation of others refusal to take responsibility and open despise
augustine of hippo wrote that humility was at the foundation of all other virtues this makes sense if ones ego is inflated one does not feel the need to practice virtues and feels entitled to never be ashamed of her shortcomingsthat are easily denied or blamed on someone else ego also leads to wasting resources on luxury parce que je le vaux bien  as says a famous brand of cosmetics instead of focusing on selfimprovement or caretaking
though girls should be the first to have their ego smashed as the survival of basic family units depends on it bloated ego is a general disease in our age men too can be sold the idea that say being a smug urban elf is a proof that one sides with progress and civilization whereas they are actually weak dependent and unable to fix anything by themselves its not all about our individual selves
 fear 
readers asked for it so here it is fear is a very powerful emotion to the point of prompting one to freeze flee abandon a previously planned course of action or never even think to consider an idea or an action the left has been using it in two different albeit complementary ways
first it has constantly accused conservatives to play on fears implying irrational or unjustified fears when they dared to ask serious questions or making realistic assessment when the  immigration act was voted democrat senators pretended that opening up the borders would not change the ethnic mix of america and that any suspicion it might happen was highly emotional in france the socialists and mainstream righters alike have been carrying the same accusations here the left accused any doubt to be a hint of unjustified and intolerable fear
well what happened since doesnt it look like every fear from the right was justifiedespecially since the postww right has always been incredibly wary not to say coward when it came to criticize the lefts moral high ground
second the left has also been keen on doing exactly what it accused the conservatives to do namely stirring fear about political bogeymen liberals invented rape culture or patriarchal oppression when men actually became weaker they associated to nazism any white person who assumes his race should basically survive they shamelessly bludgeoned whom they could call white supremacists as if defending ones right to live in peace against hordes of thugs and violent parasites was equal to being hitler himself
whites were led to fear their own supposed authoritarian tendencies as the shrewd jews who intrigued through the frankfurt school put it see kevin macdonald culture of critique  chap whites were led to fear some of their fearsbetter have ones daughter killed by muslims than expressing concerns about them to other whites because racism is so evil boo
when i was younger i noticed the local thugs had a huge advantage over us normal people they were much more fearless they had this devilmaycare provocative attitude which made them potentially dangerous to the bourgeois prude beta male and attractive to females not incidentally the first movie of the french essayist alain soral confessions dun dragueur confessions of a womanizer shows a young arab with decent pickup experience taking a young middleclass white boy under his wing as to help him escape from virginity
feeling fear is a necessary step in life fear appears greatly useful when there is something to flee from or watch as a potential hazard but being too fearful or afraid of the wrong things can be a serious liability never trust a liberal who either points finger at you for being fearful or tries to paint you as dangerous and justifying his own fearmongering
on the flip side being feared by others is not always a negative some people need to be afraid to respect you if you try to treat them correctly or let free rein to your innate generosity they will harm and exploit you such people just as everyone around who may be tempted to disrespect should be kept in check by a minimal fear better be feared and respected than getting tread upon
conclusion frame and un frame whatever matters when you have to as you have to the left cursed us by locking us into an always negative framing when we fail whatever the reason we are despised as weak or losers and when we succeed they say we are privileged and oppressive in both cases the chosen framing leads to negative emotions associated to us no matter what we actually do 
fortunately it is always possible to turn the tables provided we keep a tight frame and change these emotions as well for example when we are weak we should elicit empathy be noticed for our good intentions or noble infirmities and when we are strong we should elicit admiration and trust
think frame feel positive about us and about what we do get rid of those who wont

"home this month popular  reasons why your diet sucks  reasons why your diet sucks march    comments body 
 you have no idea how much you are eating 
ever wonder why you cant gain any muscle or lose any body fat well the first place to look for the answer is your diet are you eating the requisite amount of calories for your goals if you want to gain muscle you have to eat more calories than you burn whereas if you want to lose body fat you have to eat fewer calories than you burn there is no way around this simple fact even though this is nothing more than a grade school physics problem im still baffled by the number of guys out there whining about being hardgainers or endomorphs invest in a food scale and track your intake its really not that hard 
 you are constantly looking for the next best supplement to take 
this is the game equivalent of asking for the one magic pick up line that will allow you to swoop top shelf girls left and right the hard truth is that the vast majority of supplements are a complete waste of money guys flock to supplements because its an easy fix instead of putting in the time and hard work needed to obtain the results they desire they look for shortcuts in order to get ahead unfortunately these shortcuts dont exist the only time you should be worrying about supplements is when you have all of the other nutritional building blocks in place 
 you think you dont have the time to eat healthy 
a lot of guys complain about being too busy to eat nutritious meals made mostly of whole foods guys will also complain about not having enough time to hit the gym after work or during their lunch break the problem here is not one of time  but rather of priorities  guys would rather sleepin than get up early to make themselves a good lunch to take to work the bottom line is this if you value your health then find the time to make yourself nutritious meals ditch the excuses 
 you think there is one best diet for everyone 
ive been in this game long enough to know that there is no one particular diet that is best for everyone i remember about  years ago people were losing their minds over the atkins diet about  years later people moved on to the paleo diet and now intermittent fasting is all the rage new diets will always be on the horizon which pretty much guarantees that arguments on the internet about which diet is the best will never end i do not know what the best diet is what i do know is that all good diets have several things in common such as being based around whole foods and acknowledging the importance of portion control protein fiber and other important nutrients aside from these basics whether you eat low carb or high carb three meals a day or six meal is entirely up to you and your lifestyle but make sure you get the basics down first 
if you can get a handle on just these four areas of your nutrition you will be ahead of the vast majority of individuals out there",Fake
"the most interesting books of the bible for those who arent believers in god are the wisdom books of job and ecclesiastes written from a philosophical point of view they attempt to help people live with suffering and pain while putting existence into context
book of job 
job is a devout believer in god who follows all of his rules he has been blessed with incredible wealth and numerous children satan then challenges god by arguing that job is only faithful because of what he has gained and that he would immediately curse god if everything was taken away from him god allows satan to destroy him taking his wealth and killing all of his children
once the misfortune befalls job his wife implores him to curse god but job refuses instead he openly laments at why god is allowing him to suffer he even asks god to allow him to die
i would rather be strangled
rather die than suffer like this
i hate my life and dont want to go on living
oh leave me alone for my few remaining days job 
why make me your target
am i a burden to you
why not just forgive my sin
and take away my guilt
for soon i will lie down in the dust and die
when you look for me i will be gone job 
what do you gain by oppressing me
why do you reject me the work of your own hands
while smiling on the schemes of the wicked job 
he then has a series of poetic dialogues with priestly men in an attempt to explain gods justice job asks some pointed questions implying that those who are eager to sin seem to experience more prosperity than those who closely follow gods words
the godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine
its branches spreading across the garden
its roots grow down through a pile of stones
it takes hold on a bed of rocks
but when it is uprooted
its as though it never existed job 
when a plague sweeps through
he laughs at the death of the innocent
the whole earth is in the hands of the wicked
and god blinds the eyes of the judges
if hes not the one who does it who is job 
just like how there are so many laws in the legal code that you are always on the hook for something illegal there are also so many possible sins that it may be impossible to live a clean life
whatever happens i will be found guilty
so whats the use of trying
even if i were to wash myself with soap
and clean my hands with lye
you would plunge me into a muddy ditch
and my own filthy clothing would hate me job 
the men that job spills his guts to state that hes sinning in some way and knows nothing about how god works and that he must grin and bear it instead of questioning gods actions
pay attention to this job
stop and consider the wonderful miracles of god
do you know how god controls the storm
and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds
do you understand how he moves the clouds
with wonderful perfection and skill
when you are sweltering in your clothes
and the south wind dies down and everything is still
he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror
can you do that job 
god appears and asks job how dare he question his actions even though those actions amounted to an agreement with satan
who is this that questions my wisdom
with such ignorant words
brace yourself like a man
because i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
where were you when i laid the foundations of the earth
tell me if you know so much
who determined its dimensions
and stretched out the surveying line
what supports its foundations
and who laid its cornerstone
as the morning stars sang together
and all the angels shouted for joy job 
god goes on to describe his powers and then serves a how dare you argument to job who then accepts his utter impotence
then the lord said to job
do you still want to argue with the almighty
you are gods critic but do you have the answers
then job replied to the lord
i am nothinghow could i ever find the answers
i will cover my mouth with my hand
i have said too much already
i have nothing more to say job 
you asked who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance
it is iand i was talking about things i knew nothing about
things far too wonderful for me
you said listen and i will speak
i have some questions for you
and you must answer them
i had only heard about you before
but now i have seen you with my own eyes
i take back everything i said
and i sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance job 
other parts of the bible channel job by asking why bad on earth is allowed to continue
wake up o lord why do you sleep
get up do not reject us forever
why do you look the other way
why do you ignore our suffering and oppression
we collapse in the dust
lying face down in the dirt
rise up help us
ransom us because of your unfailing love psalm 
and the usual response is to not question god
what sorrow awaits those who argue with their creator
does a clay pot argue with its maker
does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it saying
stop youre doing it wrong
does the pot exclaim
how clumsy can you be
how terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father
why was i born
or if it said to its mother
why did you make me this way isaiah 
after job stopped questioning god he was rewarded with even greater prosperity than before
so the lord blessed job in the second half of his life even more than in the beginning for now he had  sheep  camels  teams of oxen and  female donkeys he also gave job seven more sons and three more daughters he named his first daughter jemimah the second keziah and the third kerenhappuch in all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of job and their father put them into his will along with their brothers job lived  years after that living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren then he died an old man who had lived a long full life job 
you have to be patient with god
those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy they weep as they go to plant their seed but they sing as they return with the harvest psalm 
the lesson of this story seems to be one of stoicism accept your fate dont question it and understand that what you have now can be taken from you at a moments notice if god wants to no matter how cleanly you have lived in his honor ironically this book did more to make me question gods wisdom than any other
book of ecclesiastes 
the next wisdom book is ecclesiastes purportedly written by kings david son solomon who amassed onethousand wives during his reign as king of israel his wife collection led to him serving other gods and he was punished for it when god broke up the kingdom of israel ecclesiastes is the book that solomon wrote at the end of his life sharing all that he learned
everything is meaningless says the teacher completely meaningless what do people get for all their hard work under the sun generations come and generations go but the earth never changes the sun rises and the sun sets then hurries around to rise again the wind blows south and then turns north around and around it goes blowing in circles rivers run into the sea but the sea is never full then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea everything is wearisome beyond description no matter how much we see we are never satisfied no matter how much we hear we are not content history merely repeats itself it has all been done before nothing under the sun is truly new ecclesiastes 
what is the point of accumulating wisdom in life why work hard
for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow ecclesiastes 
i thought wisdom is better than foolishness just as light is better than darkness for the wise can see where they are going but fools walk in the dark yet i saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate both will die so i said to myself since i will end up the same as the fool whats the value of all my wisdom this is all so meaningless for the wise and the foolish both die ecclesiastes 
so what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety their days of labor are filled with pain and grief even at night their minds cannot rest it is all meaningless ecclesiastes 
all is vanity
for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again ecclesiastes 
promiscuous and bad women are sent forth as a punishment from god
i discovered that a seductive woman is a trap more bitter than death her passion is a snare and her soft hands are chains those who are pleasing to god will escape her but sinners will be caught in her snare ecclesiastes 
solomon tries to convince himself that evil will not prosper but he cant help coming back to the fact that it does
when a crime is not punished quickly people feel it is safe to do wrong but even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time i know that those who fear god will be better off the wicked will not prosper for they do not fear god their days will never grow long like the evening shadows and this is not all that is meaningless in our world in this life good people are often treated as though they were wicked and wicked people are often treated as though they were good this is so meaningless ecclesiastes 
at this moment it seems that solomon goes off the rails by seemingly promoting a life of debauchery
so i recommend having fun because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat drink and enjoy life that way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work god gives them under the sun ecclesiastes 
one interpretation of this is that if you live in sin like solomon you will eventually come to the conclusion that life is meaningless all is for naught and the only purpose is to have fun the book may have been included in the bible to serve as an example of what will happen to you if behave as solomon and come to the end of your life thinking that it wasnt worth it i hope this was the intended result because otherwise it would cause you to lose faith in gods own wisdom in justice just like with job
the wisdom books of the bible raise questions of gods justice and plans for his human subjects why do people suffer or prosper why does life feel like its not being guided by god these questions vexed the jews enough that they honored other gods to get more immediate results and then jesus christ came along to say that it will all be worth itnot necessarily now but in the eternal afterlife as long as you accept him as your savior

"ive been living in south east asia for almost a decade now and over that time ive come to have a matured perspective on living here and a fair appreciation of the pros and cons of doing so like most people who come here i set off thinking i was going to live in paradise thats far from the reality let me tell you
living in south east asia has its pros and cons just like anywhere else while i myself have decided to return west for a while ill always have a connection to asia and im sure ill be back many times throughout my life
so whats the real story with living in asia is it all its cracked up to be what does a man have to be aware of when coming here lets look at six common stereotypical ideas about living in south east asia and assess them in the light of reality
 asian women are kind gentle and compliant to their husbands so sweet not so fast
this is most definitely a myth and if you come out here expecting to find some little house pet who does your bidding youll be in for a rude awakening
its definitely true that asian women in my experience are a lot more traditional they give the man his place in the house rarely question your final decisions and do not resent housework and basic wifely duties
however the idea that theyll just do whatever you tell them without question is nonsense theyre human beings with a will of their own and you wouldnt be the first guy to get a smack in the head from a fivefoottwo broad who weighs  pounds if you disrespect her
the idea that asian women are some sort of angelic alternative to western women is also nonsense while its not the norm ive met several western men who have been taken to the cleaners by their asian wives and girlfriends when you move here youre completely at her mercy and you will never have any legal rights as a citizen
asian women generally are a lot more traditional but this stereotype that theyre some sort of perfect wife material has got to go theyre individualsand there are all kinds good and bad among them
read this guide to dating asian women for a more complete perspective on the issue its a thorny subject and theres a lot of misunderstanding surrounding it
 asia is ridiculously cheap 
this is one id have to lean slightly towards agreeing with
most things in asia are a lot cheaper eating out for my entire family often costs less than  meaning i can afford to do it basically every day my rent for a condo apartment costs less than  a month although thats mostly because i live in the sticks and am not in a major city
a general rule of thumb is that outside of major cities like bangkok singapore and kl you can divide the cost of living by three and get a rough estimate
note this does not apply to consumer goods such as cars and electrical appliances which are in and around the same price it certainly does not apply to luxury goods which are often much more expensive because of the taxes placed on them by local governments
asia is cheaper overall but anything other than the basics costs roughly the same life in south east asia can be cheaper but it isnt necessarily soit depends on your lifestyle
 you can become a citizen of an asian country and stay forever becoming a citizen in an asian country is nigh on impossible even if you could you probably wouldnt want to
you can get a variety of visas like permanent residency and each country aims to facilitate the spouses of their nationals and especially retirees with proven cash in the bank however youll not become a citizen with all of the various rights they enjoy
its also worth noting while you might get permanent residence youll never be one of them even if you live here for  years you will always be a foreigner and will be viewed as such by locals this has pros and cons to it but youll never quite feel at home and accepted as one of the group
youll get undue respect from some for being a westerner but forget about talking politics or leveling criticisms at the way things are doneyoull be met with hostility and resentment for the latter
 the weather in asia is  sunshine 
the weather in south east asia is generally pretty awesome and you can live an outdoors life youll truly enjoy if youre that type
the sun shines almost every day and even when its overcast its warm meaning you can go out and about and do anything from walk on the beach to shop in the city
however when the storms come youd better be prepared to get your ass inside the rainfall and wind in many countries in south east asia is truly terrifying just switch on any news station the next time a major storm hits the philippines and youll see what its like
thankfully after  years of living in the philippines  ive never been caught directly in a major storm although ive seen the tail end of plenty of them
the weather is good when its good and utterly awful when its bad check this clip out to see how bad it can get

 asia is  years behind the west in terms of development 
this is a stereotype thats deeply mistaken and whether or not its true depends on which country you go to
true countries like laos and bangladesh are miles behind any western nation but head to singapore and youll be shocked by how far ahead of us they are in terms of tech and development
asia is developing at breakneck pace and with that development comes super highways skytrains skyscrapers and everything else we usually associate with an advanced country it wont be long before many countries out here catch up and surpass the west although it is definitely true that most of them are slightly behind for now
theres a phenomenon called leapfrogging which virtually guarantees asian countries will catch up to and surpass the west quickly leapfrogging is when they can skip all of the evolution and development and simply emulate modern day technology developed elsewherea great example is india where they have skipped the transition from dialup to mobie internet and gone straight from nothing to mobile
if you think this cant be done and there are intellectual property laws to protect tech from being stolen wholesale i salute you but i have to laugh there are no such laws and even if there were nobody would bother to enforce them
on the other hand you still have many scenes like this outside your window when you get out of the main cities

 asians are extremely family oriented again this is one i lean towards agreeing with there are exceptions to every rule but the family unit is extremely strong in asia especially countries like the philippines
i dont want to wax lyrical or speculate as to why this is its enough to acknowledge it as a fact and accept that its the case  of the asian people i have ever met and gotten to know from indonesia to the philippines to thailand are devoted to their families to the extent that wed consider it cultlike in most western countries
i pass no judgment on this whatsoever it can be a great thing or a bad thing depending on your own perspective i personally like it and think its something weve lost in many european countries and america too
this is an idea about asia i agree withthe dedication to family above individuality is definitely true and so by default if you get into a relationship with an asian woman be prepared for this
the family unit is the sun around which everything orbits in most asian countries
living in asia summary sorry to disappoint you fellas but you wont find paradise in south east asia
what you will find is a place with many opportunities pitfalls pros and cons but which i do not regret living in for a single second and which has come to be a large part of my lifes story
i came out for a year and stayed for almost a decade however ive decided that time is now over and its time to go home
id love to hear about your experiences living or traveling in asia do you find my perceptions to be accurate or do you have a different view

"home this month popular  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women  ridiculously stupid things men keep doing for women david g brown 
david is a lifelong dissident and intellectual rebel he despises political correctness which replaces real needy victims with narcissistic leftists out for a free meal though still a young man he has watched society descend into its present morass with great sadness combined with a determination to help make things better he tweets when theres something worth tweeting here  october   girls 
forget the movies that set aloof men against loveseeking women it is men who are the hopeless romantics much if not most of the time and they express this extraordinary naivety by engaging in stupid behaviors that their fathers and other male role models should have beaten out of them though feminism demographic trends and socioeconomic realities encourage women to be entitled prima donnas men add to the feedback loop by rewarding modernday princesses 
of course there are sensible exceptions to avoiding the following behaviors a time and a place for example can be found for defending a woman most notably your mother or wife from someone elses verbal or physical attack likewise sometimes emergencies or certain serious events mean you should put your priorities aside to help a highquality woman who gives longterm value to your life that said in the vast majority of cases acting in this way is unnecessary timeconsuming resourcedraining and plain selfdestructive for a man 
so here are the five things many men perversely and uselessly keep doing for women  fighting for them 
i lost count long ago of the number of times i have seen a man step in to save a woman from either herself or a slight usually deserved against her a girl will behave like a pork chop at a restaurant club or elsewhere picking a verbal or even physical argument with an employee or fellow patron along comes captainsaveaho who might not even know the girl to protect her honor the expectation of many women that men will do this for them is bad enough let alone when a man does it of his own volition without being requested 
in return for risking a physical or similar altercation with other people the white knight invariably gets a smile a few words and perhaps a phone number from this point onwards though the interaction between mr white knight and the entitled damsel who causes her own distress invariably fizzles out and it is not just members of your typical white knight crowd who act this way men who are nominally good with women fall into this trap too confusing it with the opportunity to be alpha and dominate over another male the most common outcome sadly is that a womans very poor behavior is condoned by a man falling over himself to be her medieval champion  fighting over them not only is this bickering usually illadvised it is often exactly what she wants 
this stupid behavior is only marginally better than fighting for women and the two activities consistently overlap whilst competition in life including between men over women should be largely encouraged swathes of men are effectively scrapping over last sundays leftovers on a saturday three days after the refrigerator stopped working 
remember a woman can be attractive but because of her attitude and behavior have very little longterm value for you countless men live with the illusion that if they toil hard enough to get the goodlooking girl it must be worth it thats simply not the case in modern times to boot a lot of sexually thirsty men nowadays are chasing physically lowyield women their fathers and grandfathers would never have noticed 
at best the majority of men who fight over women are dueling over the prospect of snaring a girl who one of them will probably fuck a few times if at all and if they do manage to secure the girl for a longterm relationship the pairing usually implodes down the track the man either realizes he wasted his time or suffers greatly in material terms such as by being draped divorce raped 
in the meantime the girls being fought over have their egos stroked time and time again unattractive girls see themselves as attractive and attractive girls with foul entitled princess personalities find themselves validated once more everything in these situations is predicated on the men fighting and proving themselves rather than the women reaching an appropriate standard of physical and emotional femininity  paying for them what are you getting from the transaction with her and yes everything is transactional in malefemale relationships 
unless you are completely sure you have claimed the worlds best girl for yourself and even that belief is probably based on very false or temporary appearances you should ideally be investing less financially in the relationship than she is this may seem counterintuitive especially when a man is sexually valued by women for his status achievements and resources but we are not living in a time when almost every woman is marriageable a man providing for a woman can only justify it if she is of highquality and gives him something back in return on both these counts most men are paying for dud deals 
in every longterm relationship i have had i have put less into the relationship financially proportionallyspeaking almost always even the girls gross investment has either approximated mine or surpassed it for dates and during casual relationships too i pay for a womans time about as much as she pays for mine if not less 
when relationships end girls can and do play petty games over money or property you may be owed what matters however is how you conduct yourself overall only when a woman has materially invested in you or invests in you should you invest in her when patriarchy returns the malefemale dynamic will alter before that time be sure she does her fair share financially  shifting or sacrificing their priorities for them meanwhile he should be do everything else for himself 
unlike many other selfdestructive behaviors concerning women this one can be very incremental and hard to spot it is very easy to procrastinate on your work final exams selfdevelopment goals and the rest of your social life when what you feel is a highquality woman comes along in fact nature has basically designed you to do that by throwing your biochemistry into a druglike dependency at the beginning of a courtship in addition to these problems early on men are apt to continue the shelving of their other more personal demands after the relationship is well established 
on a topic i will explore in more detail in another article there should be certain hours in many days or simply days in general in which women do not even enter your mind contrast this with your average man who will throw away opportunities to further himself to please his girl and often shes not his girl for much longer as his neglect of himself becomes apparent in her less attracted mind by devoting yourself to a ho you become dispensable to a ho not just psychologically but physically financially and socially as well dont let yourself rot 
your body finances education and other forms of selfimprovement need to be your number one focus after all they are the only things you have or dont have  hours a day  days a year individual girls may come and go but your obligations to yourself remain paradoxically keeping these obligations to yourself are what attract girls in the first place a man who takes proper care of his money career body and social life gets women  moving to them for them sucker 
this is the one even my leftwing father warned me about but its something a lot of guys are yet to learn like shifting or sacrificing ones priorities moving to a girl for a girl is conducive to throwing your own needs into utter disarray every time i moved to where a girl of mine lived i did so mostly for myself whether to explore a new country for three months or find a new refreshing place to get my work done the relocation benefited me this is qualitatively far different from upending yourself to some new city for the mere chance to thrive and the desire to please a girl 
perhaps the saddest thing about the man who moves for his girl is that when he wants even a fraction of the favor he gave her hes often left in the lurch dont make this mistake either she must move to you or you move to her for a lot of reasons that dont revolve around her if the relationship fails and most of them do you leave yourself in an equal or better position than the one you would otherwise be in dont follow the crowd of thirsty males too many men slave away in a female desert girls are not nonexistent but theyre too often lowquality relative to what a man is willing to do for them 
snap yourself out of these behaviors and help your friends shake them off too you may not indulge in them regularly but the temptation to perform them at least sometimes is likely to be there more broadly we need to see a seismic shift in the way many men act become part of the solution 
so whats just as bad as an entitled woman a man who encourages her entitlement with obsequious validation",Fake
"alain soral is an influential frenchswiss thinker author and filmmaker his beliefs are summarized as french third position basically a third party for those that reject the traditional left and right political views and there have been third position movements in many european countries over the past several decades
major beliefs of sorals ideology include nationalism political sovereignty social conservatism antiglobalism antiimmigration antifeminism antibankster and a noninterventionist antiwar foreign policy a major slogan of third position is reconciliation between the labor left and the values righteconomic policy which values individual work and labor and social policy focused on nationalism and traditionalism
early life 
alain soral was born in  in southeastern france he attended a wellregarded private catholic school before enrolling in the distinguished national school of fine arts in paris founded in  and later transferred to study under the philosopher and economist cornelius castoriadis a famous th century thinker
castoriadis 
castoriadis favored autonomous societies that are selfaware of their autonomy and independence and believed societies should provide legitimacy for their laws and government actions historically this was often done through absolute monarchy by invoking religion and god with the monarch having a direct connection to the almighty what god has commanded is what we must institute with the law
modern capitalist societies proved their legitimacy through circular tautology that is they claimed that capitalism was logical and just and therefore whatever a capitalistic society deemed profitable was therefore logical and just a just autonomous society was always questioning and challenging its laws but at the same time adhering to respecting and upholding the law
castoriadis described modern society as a struggle between creative imaginary and capitalist imaginary
the repetition of empty forms of conformism apathy irresponsibility and cynicism at the same time as it is that of the tightening grip of the capitalist imaginary of unlimited expansion of rational mastery pseudorational pseudomastery of an unlimited expansion of consumption for the sake of consumption that is to say for nothing and of a technoscience that has become autonomized along its path and that is evidently involved in the domination of this capitalist imaginary the other road should be opened it is not at all laid out it can be opened only through a social and political awakening a resurgence of the project of individual and collective autonomy that is to say of the will to freedom this would require an awakening of the imagination and of the creative imaginary
postuniversity 
soral loved books and knowledge studying radicals from throughout the political spectrum he was a dragueur de rue street pickup artist when the pua movement was virtually unknown he developed a skill at attracting young narcissistic valueless city girls and claimed to bed hundreds of women and published a book on game in  his experiences with these women led him to develop strong antifeminist beliefs
he developed a strong dislike for the french bobosbourgeois bohemians younger wealthy highly educated narcissistic hedonists interested in fashion and trends perhaps something like rich hipsters but less retro more fashionable and trendy
he joined the french communist party motivated by his dislike of the bobos and his camaraderie with the working man the communist party along with the front national were among the few opponents of the creation of the eu soral studied the works of marx and other marxists before leaving to join the far right front national where he was a speechwriter for marie le pen he noted that both communists and front national members were strongly nationalistic and indeed many workers left the communist party to join fn around this time

he became a strong critic of feminism and minority politics gay feminist and islamist or other racial multicultural groups after front national performed poorly in the  elections he formed equality and reconciliation  seeking to consolidate ideas on the left and right who believed in nationalism patriarchy anticommunism antiimmigration and antizionism er is an alternative news site with some tendencies to the american altright pronationalist and critical of modern culture and feminism he describes it as left for the workers and right for morals
he is a boxer and since  has coached boxing he records videos has a regular feature naming the cunt of the month and his works and website are very popular despite harsh attacks against him in the mainstream media
summary of views trolling a feminist
not much is available in english of soral and even english subtitles on his many videos are hard to find i have but a cursory understanding of french so i have relied on secondary sources and translations his major beliefs are
antifeminism views feminism as not prowork as women have always worked but instead as antifamily and antimother discusses two classes of feminists freaks and bitches the real struggle is between rich and poor not man and woman who are naturally attracted to each other he has attacked womens magazines as altering the social conscience and relegating women to the status of objects stresses selfimprovement and virility in men
anticapitalism and anticonsumerism opposed to valueless consumption and consumerism in favor of banksterfree economics and an end to the nanny state opposes desire society and the cult of celebrity
antiimperialism opposed to the globalist empire and american imperialism attempting to spread its cultural ideological economic social views everywhere and to destroy all nationstates
antizionism has attacked jewish lobbying and intervention in french affairs made statements criticizing the jewish people for being ostracized in societies around the world throughout history which earned him an immediate and harsh media blackout he makes a distinction between french jews and zionism saying that zionists are opposing the interests of france and french jews
anticommunitarianism favors nationalism not communitarianism calls communitarianism a poison opposed to ethnic racial sexual islamist or feminist communitarianism which is opposed to morality and national standards opposes the public effeminate homo and transsexual society and laments the lack of strong male role models makes a strong distinction between homosexuality and the gay pride community movement which promotes drag queens parties vulgar parades and hypersexualization
antivulgarity opposes vulgar language dress and speech especially in women has said he prefers publicly wearing the muslim veil to thong underwear would go crazy at a slutwalk critic of profanity and vulgarity proponent of morality and modesty
islam feels the menace of islam is an artificially created and manipulated threat primitive islamic society is not a real threat to modern western states and capitalistic globalist interests manipulate the region to destroy the antiglobalist antifeminist culture of islam to foster animosity between social groups to possibly create a clash of civilizations or world war leading to a full globalist takeover and to loot mideast nations and that the fundamental values of moderate islam are perfectly compatible with french moderate catholic views
antimodern culture and mainstream media opposed to the decline in western values and culture and the sorry state of mainstream media who has labeled him a pariah
le neo masculinitÃ© 
many likeminded red pill men are turned off by the leftright politics in america the third position combines right views on nation morality and law with some left positions on social issues and economics i believe if both the left and right hate you you are probably doing something right the ideas here strongly resonate with neomasculinity sorals ideas are stimulating and interesting and definitely deserve further investigation
an excellent summary of soral and his beliefs is available here

"disclaimer this is not legal advice if you are charged with a criminal offense or think that you may be contact your attorney 
if you are a western man under  your world view when it comes to sex was forged in the era of internet pornography epic divorce rates hypersexualized television content and a political climate of anything goes sexual identity at virtually any age you could be forgiven for thinking that when you first had sex with your sweetheart back in high school or earlier it wasnt something remarkable and youve both probably forgotten about it years later you could also be one accusation away from defending yourself in a sex offense case
while american culture evolved or as many fairly and convincingly argue de volved into a sexually open environment where there are few if any societal and legal restrictions beyond those involving children and animals statutory rape is still caught in a complex patchwork of state based laws
federal law does not stipulate a universal age of consent instead leaving it to the states to codify though you are safe everywhere in north america by avoiding all girls under  and you may think thats the law of the land federal statutes principally refer to matters surrounding pornographic material and prostitution by the wayyou didnt take any naked selfies or make a homemade porno with her right good thing you didnt because you could have violated that federal law about pornography 
what is the age of consent in america i wouldnt even trust her fake id
the age for private consensual sexual acts in america ranges from  to   sometimes lower in the case of married couples its even lower in some foreign countries by the way say youre an american student overseas with a foreign girlfriend whos legal in her country but still under you might want to check with a knowledgable lawyer before getting down a d dirty
why is this significant for starters the un convention on the rights of the child considers anyone under the age of  to be a child that magic number is also used to prosecute anyone going overseas with the intent to have sex with a minor while us law in this area is aimed at pedophiles and traffickers theres no reason it could not be applied to a young man on a trip to cancun or studying abroad in eastern europe the most likely situation for a young american male will be domestic however
dont take one for the team
for example back when you were  and your girlfriend was  and the age of consent in your state was  you might have both been well aware of what you were doing and done it several timesperhaps even with the knowledge and approval of your parents you may have stayed with her for years and eventually got married but more than likely you and she parted ways and havent looked back since
till one day you get a knock at your door from a policeman who wants to question you about your relationship a few years earlier thinking nothing of it you tell him the basic details admitting to sexual contact and bam you are arrested for statutory rape of a minor any defense of her consenting multiple times or even that you did not know she was underage is irrelevantas a minor she cannot consent and because of this she may have no say in whether or not to press charges
the long arm of the law may reach you 
well thats no bother to me since it was so long ago and the statute of limitations passed anyway right not so fast first if you have amassed any assets years later she could still decide to sue you in civil court for damages although this is not always successful  and either win at trial or eke out a monetary settlement from you even absent a criminal conviction or a civil court judgement against you having to pay a settlement for a sex assault related case is something no man wants on his resume just ask bill clinton 
moreover just because it is now beyond the statute of limitations for prosecuting you do not assume you are in the clear statutes of limitations can be changed  once again including accused offenders even though they were previously beyond the statute of limitations any statements you may have made to law enforcement before this happens would once again be fair game
while the intent of changes to these laws is noblethey want to nail child abusers who got away for decadesthe reality is you can get scooped up into the mix if you as a teenager once had a sexual encounter of any kind with an underage girl perhaps even if you yourself were underage if you think you engaged in a situation where you could be charged the best course of action is to clam up and consult lawyer in your jurisdiction
this applies even more if one day you are approached by anyone and out of the blue they bring up the subject even though youd nearly forgotten about it if you get arrested and charged but the prosecuting attorney decides to not prosecute continue to keep quiet regardless prosecutors come and go and a replacement with a political agenda could perhaps decide to reopen your case and pursue charges
branded for life 
if you get charged but by some miracle are able to cop a plea and get probation with no jail time you will probably still wind up in a sex offender registry  perhaps for life say you get luckier still and serious doubts surface about the veracity of the story and eventually the charges are reduced or dropped completely resulting in no conviction and no sex offender registry requirement for you well guess what you will still have an arrest record for a sex offense on your rap sheetit matters not that there was no conviction
imagine driving down the road years later a cop drives up behind you and automatically scans your license plate as is now common practice a sex offense arrest pops up think you stand a good chance of getting pulled over for further scrutiny what are the chances youre going away with a warning instead of a ticket that day for better or worse cop instinct is to view arrests the same as they would a conviction so its best to keep all arrests completely out of your life as much as possible
you will get no breaks so watch yourself and stfu yes of course you both knew what you were doing back on prom night and yes we know grown women teachers who have sex with minors often are convicted at trial and still receive no jail sentences  but you sir are a heterosexual man acting out on your urges and therefore a prime targetdoubly so if youre white nonislamic and attending college or boarding school particularly a prestigious institution  forewarned is forearmed
young men need to be well aware of the laws in their state before engaging in any sexual contact in situations where they could face a statutory rape accusation and if youve got a story or two from back in your glory days as the high school quarterback with the freshman cheerleader dont tell that story to anyone ever the political climate is not favorable to youand it could stay that way for a while absent a much needed reality check

"home this month popular feminism has lost the minds of young women feminism has lost the minds of young women maximus decimus meridius 
maximus is a man capital m period love truth justice liberty respect these are the lodestones pointing true to magnetic masculinity in a polarized feminist west his goal for writing on rok is to be the gadfly that provokes thought and counters groupthink october   the sexes 
the idea that feminism is dead is gaining ground all across the west one would like to think it is because of the trail blazing of the manosphere and to a great degree it is but truly the root of feminisms death was in man capital m from the very beginning one look at conan is all a man needs to know this truth 
feminism is dead the movement is absolutely dead 
the womens movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long theres no room for dissent its just like mean girls 
if they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction my wing of feminismthe prosex wingwas silenced i was practically lynched for endorsing the rolling stones susan faludi is still saying im not a feminist who made her pope 
feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women you cant talk to them about anything 
 camille paglia on rob ford rihanna and rape culture for macleansca 
neurotic women indeed 
paul joseph watson of infowarsprison planet fame was bang on in his assessment of feminism at the end of  but he may have underestimated his conclusions in my opinion feminists did not just lose the debate they lost the war 
the feminist attempt to demonize normal malefemale behaviour in public men initiating contact with a female with a hello and attempt to strike up a conversation backfired in less than a month 
when you have a woman volunteer to walk down the street as princess leia the queen of s patriarchal sexist misogyny to ridicule feminists you have lost the war for hearts and minds 
and when i say hearts and minds i mean the silent majority of young women who want nothing to do with feminism 
leia makes it clear in this video that boys will be boys so too will jawas darth vader and even yoda apparently that sly dude who knew 
and thats a good thing men and women are meant to interact and engage in romantic courtship feminists may hate this but the vast majority of women still prefer and expect the man to take the initiative to get the girl this is how men and women were created and evolved you cant fight darwin and god and come out on top 
this video shows that the majority of normal women love male attention they want men to look at them they want men to notice them why 
they want a man 
i realized this is the case when i decided to google the fast rising phenomenon of women against feminism  
this image from the women against feminism tumblr page really hits home the loss for feminism this woman was raped she is not running around spreading lies like the uva rape hoax story that rolling stone ran and had to retract  she justs wants to go back to living a normal life she does not want to be angry at all men for the crime of one of them she does not want to demonize all men in some sad attempt to get revenge she does not want to be a victim feminists have lost the female youth of millenials the very generation that is supposed to obliterate the patriarchy completely in the st century 
i understand some men who are still angry over feminism may proclaim these women are doing nothing more than crying for sympathy and attention now that millenial men have become vocal blunt and merciless in their attacks against feminism and the current generation of women it has reared  the problem with this type of kneejerk reaction is just thatyoure being a jerk yes far too many western women for comfort are no good for a relationship anymore but that does not also translate into there being no young women who are not just as frustrated and angry at feminism as you are and the feminists who claim to speak for them 
young women might not think about it as much since feminism has clearly made the road to independence an illusion easier for them to choose but these women are taking note that men are completely ignoring them now that they have surpassed men in almost all aspects of western society 
case in point 
i met a wonderful young russian blonde a little while back twentythree tight feminine so freaking perfect we hit it off immediately on first contact having myself only traveled outside the west twice i still primarily meet foreign women in my own country and every time i do i am blown away by their immediate friendliness and ease in my company compared to western girls as i conversed with this well educated and refined young russian lady she told me she was attending university and so naturally i asked her what she noticed most about the boys on campus compared to back home 
her answer was revealing boys they completely ignore the girls dont even look at them just walk on by 
this really surprised her being a feminine russian girl who expects men to look at women this behaviour by western men was completely alien to her 
men young boys in their prime s completely ignoring women on campus as they go about their day 
according to wikipedia women against feminism started on tumblr in   i see womenagainstfeminism as a sign that many young women are fed up with feminism and male bashing in western society it is not a sign of women speaking with two faces and trying to work both sides of the gender war to their advantage all you have to do is look into the eyes of this young woman to know just how desperate these girls are for a real relationship one with love and respect  i dont think men realize how significant a movement like women against feminism is 
as men we are naturally comfortable with open conflict and expressing not just dissenting but offensive opinions the very existence of women openly declaring they are rejecting feminism and risking social ostracism in a wholly feminist dominated university climate is why feminists are hyperventilating and going into apeshit mentally insane overdrive mode to try and salvage what support they have left  here are just a few mainstream articles trying to push the meme feminism is not dead and just needs a generational adjustment",Fake
"in a previous article  i discussed stretchingnamely why stretching is important for the masculine man and several stretches that you should use in your training to maximize your physical fitness and while that advice is still valid i neglected a very important concept in that first article the techniques that detail how to stretch
i am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical stretching mindset but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately but before i can discuss those i have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use
how not to stretch many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch avoid this at all costs  first and foremost as i have discussed previously in these pages you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue they evolved solely to hold fast and keep things in one piece they should never be stretched at all
the muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches as they evolved to do when stretching your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving
even when you are positioned properly no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away this is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the  antistretch reflex  to prevent muscular tearingstretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is and your body responds to this stress with pain this is a biological sign telling you that if you go further youll be risking muscle tears and should normally be a heeded warning
however if you want to do advanced stretching such as that nighimpossible benchmark of fitness the splits you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself and as luck would have it there is

relax into stretching reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practicejust ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex similarly your antistretch reflex that keeps your joints actually your muscles stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques
the most basic of these techniques is the one that i have had the best results with as usual the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one and that is the titular concept of relaxing into a stretchwith thanks to pavel tsatsouline for naming the concept
to use this technique take an easy form of the stretch you want to do using the splits as an example you would do a seated groin stretch engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle and thensit and wait

yes paradoxically relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context you are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretchin other words youre going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive
this is not something that happens quicklyfrom my experience it will take  minutes per stretch so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch tv while doing this as a side note this is literally the only time where its acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise in my opinion
as you might expect once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away you can increase the stretch a little bit more and hold it for another  minutes repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you cant go any furtherthis is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself as i cant judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop
this technique can be utilized for any stretch and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire however there are other methods in the relax into stretch family of exercises that can be utilized as well such as meditationmentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation
or you can try forced relaxation where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching forcing the muscle to relax

either way you slice it dont just brute force your stretching utilize these techniques for better results

"how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society how population growth industrial agriculture and environmental pollution may have weakened society 
a determined young man with a strong sense of his destiny  to save his country from postmodern collapse october   culture 
the global population in  was about one billion people today it stands at over seven times that amount with the rapidly growing populations of india and africa expected to increase that to at least nine billion over the coming years readers today are well used to the idea that the global south is densely populated relative to its economic size and area but this was not always the case prior to the collapse of empire europe having undergone thorough industrialization was the most densely populated continent in the world source the world at six billion united nations   un dept of economic and social affairs population division  
europe was also where the worlds social justice movementsliberalism communism and feminismbegan overthrowing the old order of kings castes and courtship with the vulgar and degenerate world we suffer today but why did this happen why did the immense increase of wealth and prosperity not correspond to an increase of human happiness but instead lead to the emasculation of men the breakdown of the family and the disappearance of religion and morality 
in these series of articles i examine the root causes of this paradox what one can do about it on an individual dietary level and what one can do about it on an individual environmental level i am a strong believer in social change through individual growth and having experienced a dramatic turnaround in the quality of my own personality and success of my outcomes as a result of following these strategies i hope that others can benefit from my knowledge and similarly make themselves into solid men popular mainstream theories for social degeneration 
many authors have postulated economic reasons for this degenerationindustrialization having deprived men of their primary roles as the masters of nature reduced their worth and attractivenessor utilityin the eyes of women relatedly others argue that technological progress which increased independence and ability for all allowed women to go their own way 
another popular argument is that increased prosperity leads to reduced incentive for disciplinerselection versus kselectionand so prosperous disciplined societies create a generation of lazy youngsters fat off the success of their parents who cause so much havoc with their short sighted policies that their civilization collapses leading to a new generation of disciplined youngsters who again create greatness one example of a shortsighted policy would be the feminist political movement which artificially separated woman from man by giving her through affirmative action socially harmful economic independence 
while all these explanations bear some truth none of them delve into the deeply emotional spiritual human and thus fundamentally biological causes of social degeneration why the mainstream theories are flawed 
to begin with a healthy man and a healthy woman even with modern technology at their disposal should not so substantially less love and cherish each other as seems to be the case today the proof of this can be seen by examining what it is women do with that technology a modern loose woman uses technology to go to places where men can ravish her even if it gives woman the ability to go it alone technology does not diminish her emotional and biological need for man 
further the availability of technology does not always translate into its adoptionthe failure of google glass is the emblematic example it does not have to be the case that smartphones are automatically adopted for slut culturethey do not have to automatically lead to female promiscuity anyone familiar with russian or japanese women who have the same technology at hand but a vastly greater sense of restraint and selfworth can attest to this fact therefore the technological argument is not sufficient to explain modern degeneracy although it is certainly a necessary condition credit ninaras credit moguphotos 
to briefly examine the argument that men no longer have nonfinancial utility in the eyes of women a man is not necessarily attractive to a woman if he actually breaks rocks or actually kills other peopleinstead being able to is sufficient 
therefore the emotional and spiritual inseparability of a healthy woman from her evolved master man remains and will remain eternally true the change in technology and the nature of mens work is not the causal factorinstead the change in preferences of both men and women explains modern degeneracy men hardly today want to lead and possess their woman and women do not respond to weakling men 
let us examine the rk selection argument if it were the case that wealth and ease begat indiscipline automatically it would be true that the rich produce weak and undisciplined progeny this may seem like a truism today viewed through the lens of the postindustrial overpopulated paris hilton west but in societies of the past it was certainly not the caserather historically the opposite has been true the weak were poor because they were undisciplined and the strong were rich because they were disciplined the poor raised weak and hence undisciplined children while the rich raised strong and disciplined ones so the cycle continued and over time aristocracies formed 
an extreme version of this disciplinedrich mentality can be seen in modern british farmers many of whom financially wealthy and prosperous drive old beaten suvs reuse clothes and generally minimize expenditures while it cannot be denied that even the modern rich have in general become mostly degenerate this is in my opinion a disproportionately visible symptom of a deeper malaise that affects society across the board 
therefore i do not rely on the technological or economic explanations for societal degenerationi view these theories as descriptive of passing symptoms or trends and not timelessly causal truthsint the population growth nutritional depletion and environmental pollution theory of societal degeneration 
having outlined and accounted for the above theories i argue instead that the degeneration of society is caused mostly by the biological degeneration of the human being that makes up the society this degeneration is caused by factors that affect the human organism on the basest level and the two primary factors are nutritional depletion of food caused by the growth of industrial agriculture which itself is made necessary by unprecedented population growth the pollution of the environment caused by industry and the introduction of unsafe technology 
according to this view it was not the boomers access to ease that made them such degenerate and irresponsible scum but rather the fact that the rapid population increase during their key developmental years meant that the growth of industrial agriculture that somewhat necessarily accompanied itthe green revolutioncreated such nutritionally sparse food that there was insufficient development of boomers brains leading to a generation of overgrown children 
further according to this theory the increased dependence on technology is not viewed as the cause of millennial autism but rather a symptom of millennial autism recent historical examples 
consider the historical path of communism which did not generally spring up in the villages this was not because the landlords were better able to control the peasants but instead because poor city dwellers even if earning a higher income than poor peasants had access to much worse food and lived in a far dirtier environment making them both mentally and physically ill the unfortunate result of insufficient mental development in a crisis situation  our aim should be to save as many leftists as possible and almost all can be 
the poor in the countryside today continue to vote conservative or liberal while the urban poor vote socialist for this same reason the rural poor despite usually being less wealthy than the urban poor are intellectually mature enough to see how harmful a controlling government can be the urban poor mostly achieve the intellectual maturity of children or adolescents and mostly feel rather than think so they support an emotionbased class war or gender war ideology 
this theory explains the early rise of social justice in europe where industrial agriculture was first adopted on a wide scale and also explains why such movements did not organically grow anywhere else until much later owing to the much later adoption of industrial agriculture it should be noted that in the countries where communist revolutions were actually successful they enjoyed no broad support but instead were able to defeat the mostly preindustrial historical governments because of these governments economic weakness and also because of extensive support by globalist or communist interests this was true in russia china and cambodia ancient historical examples 
this theory also explains the path of historical civilizationsromes case is highly instructive at its birth rome was a small collection of largely selfsufficient highly disciplined towns where the diet like in many towns of that era was a mixture of grains vegetables small farmed meats like chickens and hunted meatswhat we would call a balanced diet in this society men were the masters of their households with power of life and death over their family members while facing total responsibility for their family members behaviour only a group of strong capable and selfdisciplined individuals could sustain such a social order population of the city of rome e   million inhabitants  source wwwdavidgalbraithorg 
romes extreme martial and social discipline led to expansion as it expanded and the citys population grew the diet for most people changed over time to mostly grains farmed highly intensively shipped in from all over the empire losing a lot of its nutrition on the way simultaneously and partly as a result of rising grain production meat consumption fell reducing the populations testosterone levels leading to falling strength and willingness or ability to compete as well as rising mental illness because of copper overload 
the weakened populations increasing demands for emotion based socialism led to the growth of a massive welfare state and eventual bankruptcy hyperinflation and collapse of the central government 
india is another equally tragic example the population growth that resulted from highly prosperous nanda rule led to the growth of buddhism and the adoption of degenerate attitudes moral collapse and eventually weakness to invasion after the institutionalization of buddhism by powerhungry and utterly machiavellian psychopath ashokawho looked to weaken the brahmins hinduisms traditional moral guidesbuddhisms degenerate vegetarian curse spread like a virus and created over several generations a population of weaklings who werent again able to assert their independence for over a thousand years the song dynasty followed a similar path as these two empires being eventually overrun by the mongols the yuan dynasty population of china  source vaclab smil chinas environmental crisis  
this degradation of the diet caused by population growth has been at least a significant causal element behind the degeneracy and collapse of most prosperous sedentary civilizations the modern context 
the dramatic increase of the population since ancient times should help you understand why humans today are such fools and weaklings compared to our ancestors there is only so much nutrition in the worlds topsoil to go around and a population seven times greater than  years ago eating a diet uncorrected through nutritional supplementation for dietary sparsity will be living individually in effect  th the life that its ancestor population did is it any wonder that people today feel so weak and helpless that they want mommy government and daddy police state to give them the illusion of comfort and security 
this theory is also borne out in the data in general food today contains Â½ to  th the nutrients it did in the s which was already about  years after the adoption of modern style industrial agriculture in the west this dramatic fall in nutrition has accompanied the tripling of the global population and closeto doubling of the european population since that time while some population control seems necessary i believe that sustainable organic agriculture combined with nutritional supplementation should obviate a large amount of needed population reduction 
i hope that the reader is after consideration of these facts sufficiently convinced of the true causes behind the modern worlds degeneracy people have fairly universally across the political spectrum become weak and insane from malnutrition artificial protein may have allowed some men to grow muscles and calcium from an overreliance on milk may have allowed them to grow tall but perhaps the lack of most necessary nutrients has meant that they are generally still retarded emotionally spiritually and intellectually the effects on modern society 
this weakness amongst menand dietary sparsity has disproportionately affected men due to our much greater nutritional requirementshas not just resulted in an inability to control the destructive forces that lie latent in every society worse the fundamental outlook of men who viewed themselves as the creators of civilization the slayers of enemies and the protectors of women all under god has changed the modern millennial man is a childlike hedonist who cares little for his civilization culture or people an aspiring patriarch an example of testicular failure image credit giorgiomtbshutterstock environmental toxins 
environmental toxins are also a problem electrical oestrogen and toxic metal pollution are underresearched but may have devastating effects on human health radio waves plastics unfiltered medication and purposely added toxins in the water supply like fluoride and chlorine have deleterious effects too what can we do 
considering these realities it serves little purpose to blame women for their selfdestructive behavior while in the past like men women used to have enough emotional maturity to try to live a life of selfrespect for example by remaining virgins and not drinking alcohol they have never had much agency charisma or true self will even before the diet was empty and before they were being stuffed full of drugs and chemicals by the unscrupulous pharmaceutical industry and its proxies 
these poisons may cause serious and dangerous although slowly fixable hormonal and behavioral changes but the real effects are felt by their offspring unfortunately once a woman is hooked on these drugs for example the birth control pill or antidepressants she is unlikely to come off them and if she does she is unlikely to do anything to fix the damage to herself or her future children this is especially the case as the medical industry which has brainwashed her to see doctors and the state as her loving protectors is unlikely to recommend it 
even so these drugs dont permanently alter the fact that women as mostly emotion driven actors are biologically and intrinsically people pleasers and respond automatically to the most powerful person or group of people that can give them a raison dÃªtre even if we cant ensure that women in general improve their diet and avoid pollutants we can certainly make changes on an individual level convincing or browbeating our girlfriends sisters and mothers 
the healthier a woman gets the greater her affinity with nature becomes and the more maternal she feels so you can be fairly certain that shell try and pass on the knowledge to her children and friends like our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers did furthermore there are a large minority of health conscious women who it should be our duty to marry and impregnate as many times as possible considering the rapid population declines that will occur in the atheist and leftist segments of our countries native populations these women are our best hope for creating a viable future you will have to teach her a few things credit csp_subbotina the situation is not hopelessbut we have a fight on our hands 
in the past wellinformed people couldnt expect due to the limited and elitecontrolled nature of communication technology and the educational system to make any impact on the vast majority of the population the political fight against big agra and big pharma seemed hopeless today is different the growth of the internet and the increasing spread of awareness has meant that more people are aware about the importance of eating well avoiding environmental dangers and supplementing wisely 
this is partly evidenced by the steadily rising percentage of people who eat organic diets and the booming supplement industry i hope that in the future at least a significant portion of us can survive in a sane enough state to politically fight back against moves by globalists islamists communists and ruthless financiers who are circling like vultures over our degenerating civilizations 
on the other side of this political battle the globalist controlled medical industry has been the biggest proponent of unhealthy diets and dangerous and addictive drugs special interests have also been the biggest corrupters of regulators and the institutions created to defend the population against industrial and chemical pollution 
a system of global monopoly wealth extraction is not possible with active capable and selfconfident masculinities from proud nationstates to resist it those who seek to benefit from such a monopoly system have tried their absolute hardest to suppress natural health information but so far they have failed and the situation is only improving so there is considerable reason for hope conclusion 
our forefathers demanded to fulfill their destiny ordained by the gods to defend our civilizations against the forces of rapacious greed and murderous atheistic villainyto be the protectors and kings of our people today most men are mentally ill and have become childish hedonistic narcissists as expected the ruthless and soulless have exploited this weakness for their own benefit now that you have i hope understood the principles behind why most of us have lost the urge to fight to protect our cultures the cause and fix to the industrial malaise should no longer seem out of reach or impossible to grasp 
this area of the human condition is just one another where we stand at the crossroads of history but in my opinion it is the most important if the dietary trend of the last two centuries is not reversed and the nutritional quality of at least a significant minority of men is not substantially improved then each generation of people will become more communist more feminist and more weak than the last and the globalist special interests that seek to create a totalitarian worldmonopoly police state will win regardless of temporary political victories 
each of us has chosen a path to follow in our quest for spiritual intellectual and national salvation this is mine in my future articles i will detail the best dietary approach for strong men and beautiful women to follow and overview the most important environmental precautions we must take in our quest to fix the root causes of modern degeneracy

 airbnbs new sjw diktat 
shortterm residential accommodation network airbnb is forcing its providers to adhere to a new nondiscrimination policy  including a requirement to accept transgender people the policy takes effect on november  and is accompanied by a slew of other recent or impending changes which airbnb says are designed to make its community more inclusive those who refuse to accept the main nondiscrimination policy will barred from listing their properties with airbnb 
the major problem with airbnbs new nondiscrimination provisions is that they really just represent an euphemismbowing to a customers feelings rather than proven discrimination the overall framework of the companys policy alterations assumes that those accommodation providers accused of discrimination are actually guilty of it this rush to judgment gives little or no recourse to those who depend on airbnb to generate an income it also makes it very easy for certain protected groups most notably transgender people to falsely or very loosely claim discrimination when in fact the issue is likely to be the prospective guests temperament or perceived reliability in respecting the property 
secondly the policy changes ignore the unique nature of sharing economy sites like airbnb accommodation providers are often accepting guests into their literal homes or their sole investment property whereas hotels have roundtheclock staff including security airbnb properties are much more informal and unsupervised providers therefore have good reasons to be very judicious about who exactly they let into their residences airbnbs open doors policy treats any discrimination complaint as gospel truth brian chesky mustve drank the same poisoned water as fellow tech sjw jack dorsey of twitter 
well be implementing a new policy called open doors starting october st if a guest anywhere in the world feels like they have been discriminated against in violation of our policy  in trying to book a listing having a booking canceled or in any other interaction with a host  we will find that guest a similar place to stay if one is available on airbnb or if not we will find them an alternative accommodation elsewhere 
 brian chesky airbnb ceo and cofounder 
in addition to dictating what kinds of guests can enter their providers properties another one of airbnbs new policies which is already in force treats those accused of discrimination as immediately guilty rather than determining whether discrimination has occurred airbnb has made it clear that it will bend over backwards to find those claiming discrimination other accommodation within its network or more strangely still alternative accommodation outside its network the second arm of this discrimination response will become very interesting indeed should privatelyowned airbnb decide to go public it is hard to see how shareholders would acquiesce to a company offering customers thirdparty accommodation options that effectively deprive it of money 
airbnb is simply trying to have its cake and eat it too on the one hand it wants to create as wide a market for itself as possible now having providers offering  listings in  cities around the world on the other hand however it wants to assume total control for determining what is and what is not discrimination despite having no ability to verify pretty much any of the accusations airbnb are mere gatekeepers providing a rudimentary service that makes its bucks by the sheer volume of providers these same providers should not suffer because of the companys thinlyspread business model allegations of discrimination have been scant at best we dont question the right of people to be selective about new housemates so why not airbnb providers and their guests 
various news articles reporting on the shift in airbnb policies have only been able to point to isolated instances of even alleged  let alone proven discrimination the best that sjw enablers can offer is a deeply flawed harvard study which claimed that prospective guests with stereotypical africanamerican names like latoya and darnell were  percent less likely to be approved by the companys accommodation providers considering that a guests profile provides a lot more information than just their name the harvard research leaves a lot to be desired 
moreover names like cletus and marysue would arguably garner even less approvals both these white names and the aforementioned africanamerican names usually dovetail with some of americas least sophisticated and worldly types the exact kinds of people least likely to be allowed into someones home it has precious little to do with race and almost everything to do with runofthemill decisions about how to safeguard ones own property by entrusting it to the right people such decisions are routinely accepted when new housemates are sought so why not with airbnb has airbnb signed its own execution order  bookingcom is better than airbnb  cheaper prices always instant booking tons of apartment listings better interface and no sjw crap 
 roosh rooshv october   
just as roosh swears by bookingcom there are plenty of other options you can take in avoiding airbnb from now on like twitter the company is quickly falling under the spell of the sjw crowd it seems certain that minus a backtrack airbnb and its reputation will follow jack dorseys company into the abyss unlike twitter though airbnb may never make the jump to publiclylisted company

"it wasnt long ago that the left represented the antiestablishment wing in politics they used to fight against globalism remember the antiglobalization movement even if their motives were different from those of todays antiglobalists as well as being against censorship imperialist wars and the expanding powers of governments and corporations but today you see leftists protesting against brexit attacking and censoring anyone who disagrees with the establishment using twitter on their apple products while sipping on their starbucks coffee and are calling for war in syria to challenge the russians so just how the hell did did they end up becoming the patsies for the elites

to understand we must go back to  when the occupy movement was ongoing the occupy protests which now seem like ages ago came about as a response to the economic downturn with the people realizing that they were being screwed by the system we can debate endlessly about exactly who these people were and the motives behind them but the important fact is that to the elites it was a sign that the people were waking up and challenging their power
the elites were in a panic as this was the first time in postwar history that the people of west mobilized in mass to threaten their rule so the cabals decided that they needed to act fast before the whole movement evolved to a fullblown revolution and they already had a plan in mind the never antiquated strategy of divide and rule
the diversion 
when the people are discontent and angry from being powerless and dispossessed the pressure will mount and it wont go anywhere the people want to vent out their frustrations the elites know that responding directly with repression only inspires greater desire to rise up so instead of fighting it they prefer to rechannel that pent up energy elsewhere
on february  with the occupy movement still raging the elites were given that golden opportunityor rather they created onewhen a black teenager was shot dead in florida the none other than the infamous trayvon martin case the shooter wasnt even a full white but the elites jumped at the chance and used their control of the media to throw everything they had on it anything to divert the public attention away from them with their efforts it quickly became the biggest story of america
but they didnt stop there police shootings which have always been happening and to all races were also highly publicized by the mainstream media to stoke liberal outrage and racial tensions that led to the creation of black lives matter movementa movement that is financed by george soros and others to stir up unrests across america
did the elites convert occupy protesters into sjw patsies
the diversion was complete as the people were now more interested in racial issues than the  who were dictating their lives the occupy movement faded away and the people were now venting out their anger elsewhere although i dont have as much proof as with the rise of blm movement i strongly suspect that the resurgence of social justice warriors around the same time is also the work of the elites who want the leftists to target fellow citizens over asinine cultural issues rather than the established order
the strategy 
back in th century karl marx claimed that religion and nationalism was being used to distract the masses from the fact that they were being oppressed under capitalism if we were to apply this concept to the world today the culture wars going on now are distractions to keep the masses from undermining the power of the elites
the goal the elites is simple divide the masses and let them fight each other so that they will never come together to topple those in power meanwhile they themselves focus on expanding their own wealth and continue to implement institutional control to further their globalist plans the worst case scenario the elites want to avoid is to have the common people unite as one so they must do everything they can to fragment them by creating as many divisions as possible
my understanding of their modus operandi is this  use hotbutton issues to stir up controversy something that doesnt affect them like gay marriage race issues and all other politically correct nonsense  have the leftists either get outraged or do something that will provoke a reaction from the right  let the people vent out their anger onto each other and get at each others throats  when the issue fades away foment a new controversy to repeat the whole process by cycling through them over and over again the elites are able to maintain the status quo and keep the people from uniting against them
thus we have our current situation where the masses are divided with blacks against whites women against men islam and atheism against christianity left against right and so on but no more antiglobalization tea party movement or occupy wall street
as long as those on the left continue berating the right as racists sexists and bigots who are controlled by corporations and the right in turn accuse the left of being degenerate socialist slackers who just want freebies from a nanny government nothing will change as long as the two sides see each others as enemies who are stupid and ignorant and getting in the way of creating a decent society the people will remain divided as long as the rest of the population go berserk over wedding cakes for homosexuals the latest misogynist outrage or how a lion named cecil got shot the elites will continue to win
a couple more points to consider i know they look like an occupying army but theres nothing to be alarmed about theyre just your friendly neighborhood police doing their jobs to protect you from the terrorists
first while this article has been focused on how the left has been toyed by the globalist elites lets not forget that the right are not totally immune to their influence either remember how neocons  globalists puppets disguised as conservatives  effectively lured the conservatives in america through faith and patriotism the support they got from that base was the impetus to launch their war against iraq based on bullshit evidences of wmds and saddamalqueda link while the right has changed a lot since then there are still conservatives today who are itching for a war with russia because usa usa usa 
second it is crucial to remember that although the main goal is to maintain divide and rule it is not the end of it the elites have far more sinister aims by raising hell in societies through demographic conflicts and terrorism the elites are preparing for a total social control i get the feeling that the elites are letting the chaos and violence run its course so that the people from the two opposing camps will join together in their approval of new government measures for social control
no matter their differences when the people get terrified of savagery and disorder theyll welcome the state to intervene in the name of security europe is already getting used to large military presence on their streets while the us government is seemingly preparing for a war against their own citizens  a leaked soros memo also reveals that the blm movement is potentially being used to federalize the us police  while many people seem to be concerned about violence and terrorism it seems those are just tools used by the elites to justify a totalitarian state in the near future
the culture wars necessary fight or engineered distraction 
the issue of culture wars is not an easy one as they are important in many ways but are still forms of distraction implemented by the elites
on one hand we are playing into the hands of elites by raging against social justice and feminist pigshits instead of trying to stop the globalists zionists  bankers megacorporations  and the governments from undermining our existence really do the issues of politicallyincorrect halloween costumes and whatever bathroom trannies use matter more than the fact that the middleclass is being destroyed revelations of massive corruption in the dnc the coming policestate and the globalist wars that are causing death and destruction around the world all the drama of outrage and counteroutrage is silly when the elites are snickering as their new world order is taking shape
on the other hand culture does matter in many ways uncontrolled immigration antimale laws and censorship are all very relevant issues and as much of the leftists are now serving as pawns of the establishment the situation isnt exactly the divide and rule model i described above in a way we are now forced to fight the left and everyone else who are getting in the way of fighting the globalist elites
so does this mean we should ally with those who scorn us or should we continue playing the elites games and bicker with their sjw drones i dont have a good answer but whatever we choose to do i believe it is crucial for us to focus our battles and not get trolled into petty issues that the mainstream media wants us to focus on we should always keep in mind that it is always those at the top who are the true enemies of mankind
conclusion is there still hope 
although we no longer see grassroots movements and popular mobilization the current us election has shown that the people are still awake and sick of the establishment to me that alone is a hopeful sign that people are still willing to challenge the ruling class
with bernie sanders brought down by the establishment and his supporters scattered into different camps the only antiestablishment movement now is the presidential campaign led by donald trump this is why we are seeing unprecedented efforts by the elites to bring down trump and use disgruntled leftists against his supporters
i have my doubts about trump  but he is thousand times preferable to the certain nightmare that hillary clinton will bring to america and the world if she gets elected but besides voting i believe that it is more important for the people themselves to wake up and be aware of the methods of control that are being implemented upon us we cant constantly expect some knight in shinning armor to come rally us we must take the initiative ourselves and be willing to fight for our own destiny

why are woman attracted to me when i dance and act like an entertaining clown  why did my father not have to act like a clown to attract my mom why has society changed to encourage women to pursue exciting bad boys and clowns over good men why are institutions like the media and universities pushing women into behaviors which harm them and the family unit why is there a concealed group of elites who seem to control politicians and the most important institutions why are those institutions attacking me for speaking the truth there wasnt only one step from having fun into the nightclub to fighting back against social justice warriors and the media but several steps that had to take place over the past  years my path weaved through sex and gender relations but there are other paths as well which i describe in the  paths to realizing truth  for example minimalism is another point of entry
when you live below your means you begin to see that most people are unnecessarily living above theirs that leads to the conclusion that they were trained to live a life of excess by corporations with the complicit help of a government that wants to keep society in a neverending state of indebtedness and distraction so they ignore everyday injustices while losing any will or desire to fight the establishment the easiest stepping stone out of the truman show is to realize that consumer lifestyles are not the path to happiness and those those who chase material possessions are misguided
many other men have also had a similar path as myself whereby promiscuous sex was a device for understanding the world and deciding on behaviors that are more sustainable to the male soul while not every man gains wisdom during the stage of his life where he wants to sow his royal oats many do and they use that wisdom to devise solutions that can solve our modern problems i do not at all regret engaging in shallow sex with many dozens of women throughout the world because it has developed my thinking into what you read now even though the sex itself wasnt especially memorable and didnt give me much except momentary pleasure
from my current vantage point it really does feel like it was all predetermined as if i was supposed to participate in shallow intimacy in order to arrive at true understanding but that would imply some sort of divine providence whatever the mechanism its clear to me that many of the behaviors and ideas we hold now could be mere waystations for a grander more universal truth whatever individual journey youre a part of i hope well find out soon enough

"a subject not often discussed is the topic of how to repair strained or broken relationships it is one that comes up in everyones life so it will be useful to make a few suggestions about it here we will talk about relationships from friends family and lovers
relationships among friends we will treat first the first step in this process is to make an evaluation to determine whether the relationship is worth saving or rehabilitating it is a simple fact of life that some relationships have an expiration date when two people no longer have anything in common or their paths take them in divergent directions it may be difficult to find common ground in this situation it is always better to let the relationship die a natural death slowly rather than rapidly abrupt terminations may leave the other party with negative feelings and this should be avoided if at all possible
there are some instances where repair is not possible when someone has committed a fundamental violation of trust or respect this is a warning sign that the person was never a friend in the first place another point to keep in mind is that repair of a broken relationship requiresno demandsthe participation of both parties if the other person is unwilling to participate in the process then your efforts will be futile and will come to nothing

once we have determined that the friendship is worth repairing or sustaining the next step is to decide how to make the first approach to the other party in this we must try to evaluate the reasons for the problems in the first place we should make an honest assessment about how things got to where they are did someone say or do something that caused hard feelings on the other side was there some intervening cause that made the two parties diverge in plans and activities these types of questions must be honestly and repeatedly asked we have a tendency to minimize our own hurtful actions and exaggerate those of others and this must be kept in mind
the key rule at this point is to try to put ourselves in the shoes of the other party we must try to see things from our friends perspective for many people this can be difficult as it involves getting past our own feelings of hurt or rejection and into the shoes of the other person and yet it is essential very frequently the reasons for strained or broken friendships lies in the fact that there is some problem going on in the other persons life only by being a perceptive student of human nature can we divine the cause sometimes the only thing that caused the strained relationship was some misunderstanding that was easily curable
keep in mind that we must tryat least in our own mindsto discover the source of the other persons problem this is not always possible as human beings are not always rational but we can at least make the effort i remember in the film hoffa that there was a great line from jack nicholson he told one of his men real problems real grievances can be resolved they can be negotiated but imaginary grievances that man is going to hate you for life i have no idea if jimmy hoffa every actually said this but it sounds like something he would have said he meant that we should avoid hurting the pride of our friends we should be acutely aware how it is sometimes the intangible slights that can most rankle with a man
when you have decided to make the first step it is always better to initiate contact directly do not wait for the other person to do it depending on the circumstances this should be done discreetly and without too much in the way of overpowering insistence there is a certain type of finesse that a man should have at critical times and this is one of them the approach should be direct but neither insistent nor demanding a fish is best hooked with a lure gently laid
of vital importance here is that the approach be sincere one should genuinely want to contact the other party sincerity is the glue that binds friendships together and permits their longevity there should be no hypocrisy or falsity in any of our dealings with friends this kind of thing is immediately apparent and once detected its whiff surrounds the offending party like a permanent cloud if the other party is receptive to the approach we can then gradually feel our way forward taking care to avoid the reasons why the friendship became strained in the first place things may never quite go back to what they were but at least we can find solid ground for a new frame of reference
two examples will suffice here the historian william shirer worked closely with famed correspondent edward r murrow when the two were in germany in the s yet after the war was over the two grew apart shirers account of the estrangement suggests that he was repelled by murrows enthusiastic adoption of the anticommunist hysteria of the time shirer found himself gradually blackballed from most major news networks before being forced out completely he broke with murrow over these events many decades later he approached murrow all venom spent the two were able to find common ground again

another example makes the same point theodore roosevelt was a strongwilled insistent man to say the least he was in a position to choose his successor as president and to this end he selected a man very different from him the affable and rotund william howard taft taft eventually began to find roosevelt an overbearing and unwelcome presence in his life the two men eventually broke completely a result of their personality differences and different conceptions of leadership to his credit roosevelt eventually approached his old friend privately to patch things up they were never the same of course but at least some cordiality was restored
relationships with family are of a fundamentally different sort because we are linked by bonds of blood or perhaps marriage it will be more difficult to disentangle ourselves from those with whom we have become estranged on the other hand it may be easier to repair such grievances or at least find common ground since there may be more shared experiences with the other party that act in our favor the key here is not to expect too much although shared history and common blood may work in our favor they can be counterbalanced to some extent by the fact that irrational family antagonisms can run deeper than those from strained friendships patience and persistence are most important here perhaps more so than friendships with those unrelated to us

repairing strained relationships with lovers is perhaps the most difficult when a man and woman have been united in the past through the coital act an entirely different set of emotions and motivations come into play relationships between lovers can fail or become strained for an infinite number of reasons and it would be impossible to discuss all of them here it is enough for me to state my opinion that it is nearly impossible to bring an intimate sexual relationship back to what it was after it has been broken
strained is one thing broken is quite another my own experience leads me to believe that once a sexual relationship is done it is done one cannot really go back to what it was before amicable dealings are certainly possible and happen all the time but i would not call this friendship i would call it an uneasy equilibrium loves inflammatory presence scorches all it leaves in its wake

"october has been a portentous month for the presidential campaign in the beginning of the month women came forward accusing trump of unwelcome advances later fbi director james comey reopened the criminal investigation of hillary clinton after finding more government emails on pervert anthony weiners computer but the most important event may be a meme campaign that highlights hillarys support forcing women to register for the selective service
the meme campaign consisted of dozens of fake ads posted under the draftourdaughters hashtag that highlight two very important policy points of the hillary campaign first hillary is a radical feminist thus she favors equality in all thingsthat includes equality in combat as a step in that direction hillary told the huffington post that she will support legislation to register for the draft
young women may think registering for the draft is not a big deal they should reconsider because of the second policy of the clinton campaign she will almost certainly start a war against russiaa war that will see those young women drafted into combat on the front lines
hillary has repeatedly blamed russia for wikileaks and she stated that she would get revenge through military action
as president i will make it clear that the united states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious political economic and military responses 
the draftourdaughters campaign could be the thing that brings down the hillary campaign to get elected hillary relies on two demographics people of color and liberal white women up until now women have been able to support leftist social policy because it did not impact them negatively if they become aware that hillary intends to draft them into combat to fight a war with russia they may rethink the wisdom of their equalist position
here are some of the best examples of the draftourdaughters campaign

i feel this one is the most powerful it clearly states hillarys intention to put women into combat and start a war with russia unlike the arab nations that the us has been toppling for the neocons russia has a formidable military and nuclear weapons any military conflict will not be short and easy that means it will highly likely that young women will soon find themselves getting blown to smithereens if they elect hillary



the above three ads all target the weak cowardly men who either support hillary or the never trump cuckservatives in the alt right these men are frequently portrayed as being cuckolded by wives hence they are often mocked for their wives having children who are not their own my wifes son or my wifes daughter
the ad below drives this point home even more forcefully while women might encourage their men to vote hillary or oppose trump for being too alpha they secretly despise the weakness of these men

the following ads are directed to convincing women of the ramifications of their decision to vote feminist feminism taken to its logical conclusion means you are going to have to trade your louboutins for combat boots


 


lots of the ads emphasize hillarys extremely aggressive stance toward putin and russia she has blamed wikileaks on russian hacking even though there is no proof that the russians were to blame and she and the obama administration have been saber rattling against russia in syria
the really frightening thing is that mainstream pundits are now starting to parrot the idea that the us must go to war with russia all the more reason to elect someone who is not controlled by wealthy donors like hillary


the ad below indicates that our enemy putin has a saner view on women in combat than the democrats do

while the campaign is mostly geared to point out hillarys intention to draft women it also reminds men that their lives will not be spared in the conflagration that hillary will start

the media often portrays war as a sanitized affair a soldier safely positioned in a uslocated command center controls a drone that takes out the bad guys the reality of war is that people from both warring factions die and are maimed once hillary gets in it wont be just men dying in large numbers women will experience equality in having their lives snuffed out


a final ad drives home the point that the future war with russia and iran and syria will not be any sort of conflict against barbarism or evil it will be for hillarys power trip 
conclusion elections matter for decades women have voted for leftist policies that have put the burden on other people if they are successful in electing hillary they will face the bitter consequences of their decisions but unfortunately they will not be the only people impacted thousands of innocent americans russians syrians and iranians will also have to pay the price of their virtue signaling
the draftourdaughters campaign may be enough to wake some of them up from their folly

"the greatest trick that feminism has pulled is to convince the masses that women are presently disadvantaged relative to men
it is true that at first glance men dominate every field from business to pokÃ©mon go achievements  which can lead some to think that there is a conspiracy against women but the male superiority in many fields is exactly what allows society to prosper years after the humiliating debunking of the wage gap its time to address the real elephant in the room the fact that women dont pay taxes
a research report on the fiscal contribution of men and women across age groups was published by the victoria university of wellington  lets explore the key findings

this is the wellknown earnings gap incorrectly referred to as the wage gap womens preference for low paying jobs among others is a factor at play here another factor is the amount of women working part time the average week for women in this research was  hours and  for men the workforce participation rate did not differ between men and women in significant ways

this is the disposable income this is the income remaining after deduction of taxes and other mandatory charges available to be spent or saved as one wishes you can see that progressive taxes unfairly impact males  and reduces males disposable income near womens although the market income was almost double that of womens if it disproportionately affects men  you can be assured that no one will complain

those are the raw taxes paid by men and women the tax gap has oddly never been an gender issue until now

when the tax money received by men and women is included in the equation you can see that for most of womens lives except between  to  they receive more tax money than they supply the state with men on the other hand give the state more tax money than they receive from  to  years

this is where it gets upsetting as you can see womens short period of positive fiscal impact doesnt come close to counterbalance an already massive overall negative impact the net fiscal incidence on men is approximately zero when accumulated over all ages as such society invests in young males and they subsequently pay back societys investment women bear massive costs to society while we were taught to see them as underprivileged
by the end of her life the average woman will cost about  to the average taxpayer this means that an average man is extorted  in his lifetime that will be directly transferred to women if men could use that money to their will women would chase men as much as men chase women nowadays
there are a few confounds that need to be ruled out the authors mention specifically that health and education costs are almost equal for men and women also the workforce percentage doesnt exceed  difference between men and women women dont spend more for children either according to the report even if there were confounds that needed to be accounted for this is not something feminists have done for the cent wage gap they have compared raw percentages without accounting for any confounding factors
also these numbers do not include massive costs for the governmental budget for womens issues that is a massive burden for the state for instance my local government from a canadian province of  million people just announced a  plan to fight sexual violence against women  after two immigrants dingdongditched women in a student house 
add to that millions invested in sexed programs in which a feminist teaches boys that porn movies tailored for them shouldnt be imitated and that instead that they should have their partners pleasure in mind while teaching the exact opposite to girls the government takes money from males to empower women into hating men and their contribution to society
httpstcornbrpfws quÃ©bec canada announces  million plan against sexual violence after two foreigners touched female students
 nicolas kilsdonk nkgervais october   

the data also doesnt include all the money directly and personally transferred from a man to a woman for instance while women make so little they still account for  of all consumer purchases  and you were wondering why marketers so desperately try to appeal to women in advertisements
a metaphor for male taxpayers and women this is a real danone ad watch it here or see my comment here 
the only defense that feminists can use when confronted with these facts is that women invest so much time in children however feminists made it very clear in the past decades that a womans contribution to society shouldnt be based on her involvement with children moreover at birth rates of half the necessary  birthrate for population stability theyre also doing the children thing pretty badly
these findings raise a serious question would feminism survive a libertarian regime that doesnt involve male tax money after all it is not a coincidence that women consistently vote for a welfare state within  years of womens suffrage in the usa the government doubled their tax expenditure and revenue  womens voting patterns have made the government become the new providing husband but this time the providing husband doesnt get a woman or children in return remove taxes and no woman will ever claim to be a strong independent woman the state is cucking you a little like if prostitution was not only legal but free  most guys would probably be strong independent single males
pretty ironic that the institution that gives money to women for being pregnant prevents them from being paid less makes abortions affordable is entirely supported by men feminists are not seriously against living in a society entirely supported by men they are just against men having the autonomy over the wealth they create male wealth is a public good and female wealth is her body her choice

"the above photo was snapped in ferguson as thugs burned the city down could we see a repeat of that fateful event and perhaps a worsening of it soon to a city near you
the election is the focus of every news channel ad nauseum but few people are focused on the day after the election no matter who wins this years presidential selection the possibility of civil unrest the day after election day and beyond is a real possibility are you ready for chaos if it develops
the nation is so divided we are likely to run into problems
the ugliest scenario for the day after election day plays out if trump wins if trump wins get ready for black lives matter the black panthers the race la raza and other racially motivated antiwhite groups to come out and possibly start burning cities down again after all they have been given carte blanche all year long to do so in ferguson baltimore charlotte and san jose  a worrisome precedent has been set
of course trump wont be in power the day after election day we have to wait until inauguration day for him to clean up any potential messes so barack hussein obama is likely to give the racial hate groups the green light once again while the media whips out their collective stradivarius plays my heart bleeds for thee and sympathizes with the devils destroying the nation
if the bitch wins conservative groups may clash with leftists over rights being stripped away
if hillary wins theres the real possibility of protests the day after the election and the social conditioning of whites to be polite and docile even as theyre railroaded in what was formerly their nation may not hold this time around a hillary win means the chaos and possibly violence could wait until she starts stripping constitutional rights away then we are likely to see conservatives finally come out and start raising some righteous hell there could be racially motivated clashes on the horizon as white people standing up for themselves goes against a longestablished narrative that theyre all evil racists
few people think of the effects civil unrest could have on their livelihood and wellbeing its time for a little education on just how thinly stretched the american supply chain is and what could happen with only a shortterm disruption in it
heres a scenario  just one of many possible scenarios video of rioters stopping and then looting a semi tractortrailer in charlotte is worrying because if trucks stop america stops if attacks on truckers happen often enough truckers may decide its not worth the risk to their lives to continue moving freight around and stop driving within a day bedlam could ensue as the supply chain runs on a razors edge in modern america and everything from food to medication to gasoline starts running out
supply chain rioters broke into trucks on i and burned cargo in charlotte
according to the american trucking association ata a disruption of  to  hours means hospitals and nursing homes would run out of food fuel supplies at gas stations would also run out in that time frame garbage would start to pile up most grocery and retail stores would start to run out of food and merchandise atm and bank cash supplies would also run out
the tight rope the corporate system walks quickly breaks when merchandise stops moving
as an example the ata tells us this is what happens during a hurricane imagine what would happen with days or weeks of rioting in major cities
in a hurricane situation supplies that would normally last a few days such as water powdered milk and canned meat typically disappear within one day given these inventory rates this means that perishable goods could be depleted in a matter of days and nonperishables in just a few days runs on food and nonfood staples during hurricanes and even before big winter storms provide a good example of how fast some retail inventories can be depleted during panic buying the same quick depletion of inventories could occur if trucks stopped making deliveries for any reason
panic buying means no food on the shelves when people dont have food at home and then the grocery store doesnt have food rioting will intensify things could get ugly in a hurry as one small disruption leads to a domino effect after which bedlam ensues
so it is best to be prepared with nonperishable items just in case things get out of hand have at least several weeks food supply on hand but how do you stop people from coming and taking your stash
be armed the police wont be around to protect you if bedlam ensues
contrary to gun propaganda from the media  you absolutely want to be armed in the event the election and its aftermath dont pass peacefully what happens when stores no longer have food and gas stations no longer have gas gangs form looking for homes that do have those items
theyre going to pick out the weakest home in the neighborhood and pounce
a home with guns is a safe home just as this youtube video shows  armed thugs may bust into a house looking for money or food but they started jumping through plate glass windows and scrambling like cockroaches once the homeowner came out with guns blazing
several handguns with extra ammunition are advised know how to use them be steady with the trigger and dont be afraid to use them if looters come to your house
the police will not be there to protect you as theyll have their hands full with the chaos
better to be safe than sorry the idea of an intact nuclear family may be a trite memory but protecting your loved ones is still key
with the meltdown of america happening right before our very eyes we are entering an unstable period in the nations history to say the least no matter who wins the election the nation we once knew and loved is passing away trump may be able to turn things around temporarily but even if he does the country now has so many immigrants it will be impossible to assimilate them all
we are entering a period in which america will resemble a third world country more and more the demographics of the nation are being changed on purpose so white people are diminished at the ballot box and democrats will gain a lock grip on the levers of power in the nation in the coming years  divisions between rich and poor will grow and the evil media will be there stirring the pot with racial class and gender division every step of the way  peace will become a thing of the past as squabbling factions compete with each other for dominance
in this transition from prosperity to despotism it is best to be safe than sorry the day after election day will be telling in that it will set the tone for the next four years it may be a somewhat peaceful turn towards communism if the bitch wins or it may not be
but my money is on a steady degradation of civil society in the coming years tend your own garden as i know i will be tending my own my military friends are already discussing what will happen in shtf scenario you should be thinking about it too

"return of kings has a great variety of information about many subjects improving your social life  health and fitness  tourism  among several others still our political perspectives might be offputting to some readers on the left although you could tune out whatever you dont agree with you might do well to take a closer look not all of us agree on everything but we do have a rough consensus on some items
our views on the political establishment the left blames corporations while the right blames the government when in reality the two interests work together to subvert the will of the people
its pretty easy to see that this site has a mainly conservative perspective especially on social matters not all of us started out that way many of us began our journey away from the political orthodoxy after realizing what a mess feminism has made of society others have been turned off by political correctness once upon a time i used to be liberal and i know im not the only one be that as it may some of us are actually friendly to liberalism 
by the way we dont give a free pass to the mainstream conservative establishment either unfortunately the government in countless ways seeks to amass power for itself while producing fear and dependency in the populace really its not a democrat problem or republican problem theyre basically two sides of the same coin heads they win tails you lose
surely youre in favor of progress one good question though is what exactly this constitutes  also who gets to define what is progress all that might seem rhetorical but these are important matters likely you see change as a good thing but whos setting the agenda deciding which direction that change goes actually we have answers for all that
in fact we might have some more in common with you than you expect dont care for agribusiness neither do we  are you troubled by the influence of the ultrawealthy in the political process we are too  do you suspect that the powerful have set up a system of managed democracy where theyre pulling the purse strings of both the republicans and the democrats if you supported bernie sanders youve probably figured that one out already we understand you
todays political and social scene 
you might be disenchanted by some of the things going on with the democratic party today perhaps youve heard of their hypocrisy and contempt for the public  are you troubled by some of the clinton scandals maybe even wondered if there was more to it than you expected 
perhaps your questioning goes deeper you might wonder who hijacked liberalism  it once stood for helping the working man but some time in the s it turned into so much squabbling divisiveness actually theres a reason for that  the culture war began long before the s that wasnt about liberation but rather a deliberate attempt to spread divisiveness and weaken the fabric of society
also taxpayers have spent untold money on social programs but why dont they solve problems instead they create intergenerational poverty you might be shocked to learn that encouraging dependency along with taxing and spending to oblivion was actually a stratagem meant to crash the system  thats not about helping the disadvantaged its about using them schemes like thesecausing societal upheaval so a socialist paradise will magically fall into placeare pretty reckless
you might shake your head in bewilderment at online mobs of misguided youths spewing bile about things that dont really matter sure youre against police brutality as am i but deep down you also fear what will come of all this open contempt for the law and violence against police  the authorities take a pretty dim view of cop killers kind of sounds like someone behind the scenes wants to start a lot of trouble doesnt it
finally you might wonder if the people on top of the liberal establishment really give a damn about the common people we think its rotten that theyre using so many wellmeaning people for the cynical ends of amassing money and power
likely you have some nagging concerns about whats going on in society today why are women both liberated and spoiled  and sometimes even hostile cant the feminists see that things arent really so bad  sure youre all about tolerance and have lots of gay friends but you privately wonder if there should be sensible limits  you might be uncomfortable with all the evangelizing of alternative lifestyles especially if you have children in school
you consider the press to be the bedrock of a free society but you have doubts about journalistic integrity  hey we understand the propaganda is everywhere even in shows for young children  the media has been feeding you bullshit all your life and we think their lying is rotten you deserve better than that
starting to reconsider 
a diehard social justice warrior will seethe with rage for me bringing up these uncomfortable facts even if youre a moderate you might be reluctant to consider any of this we understand rethinking deeply held beliefs is a painful process for so many things youll see that what youve been told is right is actually wrong and what is wrong is really right
many on the left have been there before and found their way out for me someone explained that im not responsible for the worlds problems its not your fault the endless attempts in college to ram opinions down my throat hardened my resolve others whove made the journey have different stories some got religion others realized that their past fanaticism has hurt others  some wondered why decades of costly social programs havent accomplished anything some came to see that preferential treatment in hiring decisions is anything but fairness
its in your best interests to purge the misconceptions and guilt trips from your mind still you dont have to abandon everything and embrace the polar opposite some have reached a synthesis position 
welcome to the other side 
if youve read this far with an open mindand checked out some of the referenced articlesthen you might be confused perhaps youre tempted to reject our message on the other hand you might be shocked and even angry about whats been going on in politics and society
we understand enlightenment is a painful process were here for you the truth hurts but well do the best we can to tell it like it is which is much more than can be said for what youll see on television ive merely scratched the surface here stick with us and youll see how deep the rabbit hole goes

"donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests donald trump is the candidate for americans not special interests luke stranahan 
luke stranahan is an engineer by trade and an armed patriot by inclination he writes for return of kings as a leisure pursuit and an attempt to do his part to help reverse the slide into moral decrepitude of modern society follow him on twitter november   politics 
next tuesday is the american election and for better or for worse well pick the next president at that time assuming we dont get mired in voter fraud and recounts and well either brace for government mandated sjw enemas or bask in a temporary setback of those evil people but today i want to talk on trump once to match an article from last week and i intend to focus on how he is the american candidate as opposed to the special interest groups one 
i had a conversation last week with some people who acted as sjws but were later presented by a mutual friend as libertarian the discussion immediately went nasty with my opposition painting trump and anyone who supported him as a racist and a bigot upon trying to determine why two of the lefts ubiquitous labels were applied to me this time i learned that their perspective was unless you were universally for all special interest groups you were a bigot or a racist false dichotomy and the american nightmare 
the problem i found out was that these people have distilled the political spectrum down into a black or white situation either you want all refugees here from the middle east all the hispanics from any country south of the border to come here freely and citizenship for those already here and that any black people shot by police are just misunderstood and were turning their lives around or youre a racist theres simply no middle ground 
they dont understand that trump is not a special interest candidate by which i mean that he is not going to put any minority group ahead of the rest of us at our expense but he is not racist towards minorities or sexist towards women 
it is possible to be against illegal immigration but treat americans of hispanic ancestry as valued citizens whom you will represent it is possible to be against feminism affirmative action and the persecution of men for the profit of women yet still value american women as americans themselves it is possible to note that some black people cause a disproportionate amount of crime yet note that some police are racist and see that there are bad and good cops and bad and good black people 
the american dream is that all men are created equal and thats men as in humanity not just males it is not that all men are equal and theres a big difference to note here you have the same opportunities as everyone else when you are born with the exception of disability and i do not know anyone myself included that is against governmental aid for the disabled 
what we have instead is the american nightmare where the left uses government and taxes for the most inane of causes trying to fix any disadvantaged groups lot real or imagined so that things will be better they take from the producers and give to the nonproducers so that according to their idealistic vision they will suddenly become productive members of society or become addicted to the welfare tit and vote democrat for the rest of their lives the good of the country over that of the individual 
long gone are responsible democrats like kennedy who told us to ask what you can do for your country every recent democratic president from carter to obama and most of the democrat congressmen view the working middle class of the country as simply a group to exploit for their pet special interest groups trump is the first candidate in a long time who isnt for the blacks or the gays or the muslims or the feminists or whatever and that matters a lot 
the reason why not being for a special interest group which is all that hillary is for with her youth vote black vote womens vote gay vote etc is so important is that these groups even put together do not matter when it comes down to the good of the country dont get me wrong theres plenty of good hardworking black people just like theres the same for women and for gays and for young people but these hardworking folks from all these groups arent going to be part of the blm or la raza or lamda because theyre too busy being productive americans activism is for unemployed people 
whats going to happen if we dont placate blm and just ignore them they riot a bit more and some get arrested what if we told them that people that commit crimes to protest being treated like they commit a lot of crimes is assbackwards thinking and counterproductive to their goals theyd quit rioting 
what would happen if we shut the mexican border down to illegal immigration but made a straightforward but strict path to citizenship for hispanics that wanted to be citizens what if we said this is america we appreciate your culture and encourage to preserve it and your language in your children but the national language is english and all business and schooling will be done in it and in it only and its your choice to not learn it but the difficulties that will arise from that choice are all on you theyd be americans proud of their heritage and their legal immigration and citizenship as well 
what would happen if we told gay people that its cool if they have civil unions under the law and have the same rights as everyone else but its not cool trying to pick a fight with a christian bakery to make the government hall monitor come drive them out of business just because their belief in their god and that youre sinning makes you uneasy and worried that they might actually be right 
what if we told them its ok to do whatever you want with another consenting adult but you dont have to try to make fiveyearolds decide if theyre gay or straight when they shouldnt be wondering about that till puberty hits theyd be normal americans who just happen to like sex with the same gender and theyd quit pushing their agenda and being obnoxious and in the rest of our faces 
what would happen if we talked to muslims and said that there is a huge deafening silence when it comes to the subject of islamic terrorism from them that makes it hard to trust any of them what if we told them that we needed their help to bring the religion out of its tacit acceptance and support of terrorism and part of that help means supporting us vetting muslims coming here more strictly until they are no longer statistically more likely to be terrorists than people of other religions and ethnicities theyd go along with that and maybe realize were fixing a problem not hating a people 
what would happen if we told women that feminism has all but killed modern marriage due to universal punishment of divorced men and that no punishment for falserape accusers both makes men not trust women and insults any real rape survivor what would happen if we told them that giving them jobs for their genitalia over their skills is destroying industries by lowering the only standard that matters that of merit that of excellence 
what if we told them that gender ratios and quotas may fix the macro view of sexism but make the man passed over for the position solely because you were female pissed as all hell towards women and when you do that to the majority of men youll be just as successful and just as hated by men as men were and were hated by you in years past theyd realize that its not a competition its a cooperation and maybe skill should be valued over sex 
what would happen if we stopped all these divisive issues that really dont do anything other than tear us apart and work on a better economy on rights for all on border security what would happen if we simply looked at each other as americans and put us all of us first what would happen if we ripped out the crap in the federal government that overtaxes people or deploys armed forces against our own countrymen what would happen if we made the supreme court constitutional again and made term limits a reality for congress maybe we could get a government for by and of the people again maybe america can indeed by great again like the man says conclusion 
im not in a special interest group no president outside of george w bush right after the september th attacks that i can recall since my childhood has been for me as an american ive always been someone to be taxed to be disarmed to be hated to be blamed its not racism or bigotry to want us all to be treated as equals and not be penalized for real and imagined wrongs that occurred in the past before i was born or more recently yet with which i had nothing to do 
im not part of the problem im an american the people who say i am part of the problem are the problem their candidate mired in scandal corruption and treason is hillary clinton mine with a message of hope for the country not just some groups in it is donald trump",Fake
"whether you are looking to attract a longterm girlfriend or wife or you are experimenting with shorterterm liaisons learning the art of seduction is essential reams of content have been written on the topic both on rok and elsewhere indeed its possible to get lost in a tsunami of pickup advice
but while it can be useful to absorb successful peoples techniques a shortcut is to observe their habits and adopt them yourself to that end here is a list of the top five habits ive observed in men who are great with women
 they take every opportunity 
guys who are great with women recognize and take up every opportunity that is presented to them in this way they are somewhat akin to entrepreneurs they know that the market is in a constant state of flux and that change is at the heart of opportunity as such like the speculators of pussy they are they are never afraid to launch a takeover bid regardless of the circumstances
game writers will often advise men that they should be approaching all the time i would wholeheartedly endorse this i would also add that however many opportunities youre taking now there are always more to be had i for example will try to get my first approach of the day in in the morning while im traveling to my office on the subway there are so many cute girls on their way to work in london or any reasonablysized commuter city and yet guys wont talk to them rationalizing that it is too early shell think im crazy or whatever in actual fact ive probably taken more phone numbers and set up more dates through morning approaches than at any other time
so next time you are out and about and see an attractive girl be sure to approach her whatever the time or the circumstances it is only by being present and open to all prospects that you will truly optimize your game
 they notice and follow up on iois 
while most game advice is centered on what the guy should do in order to attract the girl the fact remains that there will be many times that girls will shoot you socalled indicators of interest or iois without you having done anything
while i would never advise anyone to rely on these as a mainstay i would counsel that you should always at least do your best to notice them and to follow up with alacrity not only do direct iois frequently lead to sex but also if you fail to pursue a potentiallyinterested girl you may find yourself regretting it for a long time afterwards men after all are the more romantic gender there are few more lasting selfinflicted wounds than the thought of that beautiful girl who smiled at you at the museum and who you just know you could have dated had you had the courage to speak to her
the successful seducer is always on the lookout for iois therefore and hell execute quickly when he gets them even if it means deviating slightly from his routine for example a while back i was on a subway train when i got strong direct eye contact from an attractive petite and very feminine brunettejust my type once youve been in the game a while you will learn to distinguish a solid ioi from casual interest but the best way to describe it is as that rabbit in the headlights look that girls give when they are truly smitten
well she was giving me that look and i knew i had to follow up when she got of the train i went right after her introduced myself on the platform took her number and then left a drink and then several awesome sex sessions ensued later had i not taken the time to go after her then we would never have connected
remember always be willing to go after a sure thing and never leave money on the table
 they stand out from the crowd 
every truly successful seducer i have ever known has found ways to differentiate himself and stand out from the crowd this can manifest itself in many ways but primarily im talking about standing out physically in terms of what you wear and standing out in terms of your personality
while the old concept of peacocking is rightly maligned by both men and women these days there can nevertheless be little argument with the fact that all else being equal the better dressed man will be more successful than his slacksandsweatshirt counterpart a former colleague of mine who has slept with more women than anyone else ive ever met was particular about his clothes to the point of obsession
i appreciate that this will immediately cause some people to question his masculinity what real man takes so much care over his clothes but remember that narcissism is one of the three dark triad characteristics that are like catnip to women along with machiavellianism and psychopathy therefore taking time to select a silk pocket square that contrasts dramatically with your blazer plus the right trousers and shoes will help your cause a lotif you remember that your main aim is to stand out rather than blend in
your personality too should be larger than life dont be obnoxious but as a rule of thumb try to ensure that you are louder and have more to say than the other men in the group
 they are dominant 
there can be no doubt that women are attracted to masculine men and that means that to be a contender you need to be dominant now of course the massive and blatantly obvious caveat here is that you should also be ultimately respectful and appreciate that no means no nevertheless within these boundaries it will serve you well to ensure that your body language your tone of voice and your general demeanor communicates dominance  both of the woman you are interacting with as well as any men in your vicinity
the key thing here is to appear decisive and unwaveringeven if secretly you arent for example after youve had a couple of drinks with a girl on a date try getting up taking her by the hand and simply leading her to a taxi when she questions what youre doing just say were going back to my place to watch a movie doing this will communicate that you have had similar success with women before and that you are not intimidated by her
now in the back of your mind you may well be uncertain that she will acquiesce and thats fine  just do the actions anyway and see what happens shes much more likely to want to go home with you if you demonstrate leadership and even if she doesnt she will still respect you more which will pay dividends the next time you meet
 they dont apologize 
highly successful seducers never apologizeor certainly not for minor social infractions anyway the fact of the matter is you cant make an omelette without breaking eggs if you are the kind of guy who frequently approaches women while demonstrating leadership and a certain kind of cockyfunny humor then the chances are youre going to offend someone every so often
now im not recommending that you should be a dickbe classy and convivial in all your interactions but the truth of the matter is that the real seducer always ruffles a few feathers in his quest for vaginal valhalla if someone gets offended then make a joke but dont apologize as long as have acted lawfully then you have nothing to be sorry for
remember an apology is a submission to someone elses frameand that is never a good look

"not since the miniskirt has there been something worn by so many women who should never have it on in the first place 
 alan sorrentino a sexagenarian gay man in his letter to a local rhode island newspaper
a senior citizen and selfdescribed short little gay italian in rhode island has been the victim of a vicious intimidation campaign by feminists with too much time on their hands after he wrote a newspaper letter saying that women over  should not wear yoga pants the backlash against alan sorrentino was vitriolic  women marched on his home which was publicly shared using the excuse that it was just a neighborhood protest
in retaliation for exercising his first amendment rights which you might have incorrectly thought encouraged violence given the heavyhanded feminist response sorrentino received threatening calls and explicit death threats publications such as the washington post regarded the shameful intimidation of an old man as some kind of fun outing rabid social media users and the protesters themselves also lost sight of the context of sorrentinos letter and later comments which pointed out that men rocking up to supermarkets in speedos would be considered inappropriate too
violent gay man whose fashion prescriptions in a newspaper reaching only a few thousand people are capable of disemboweling feminists and ejecting them into space
if anything the moronic march on sorrentinos home and throughout his neighborhood demonstrates the paucity of real issues women have to complain about for all the talk of the misogyny and patriarchy that triggered the march pun intended these women were able to assemble freely in one of the most liberal states in america and harass without interruption an old white male albeit not a straight one they evidently did not feel the fear they continually reference in their diatribes where were the saudistyle female dress code police or the rape squads of the rape culture they always talk about to teach them a lesson alas the dastardly misogyny and patriarchy must have chosen to remain invisible again
women tell men what to wear all the time i didnt see anyone staking out jennie prices home for telling her husband and other men what to wear image attribution martin spaven
it goes without saying that one of the biggest criticisms leveled by women towards their boyfriends or husbands is their allegedly bad fashion sense even beyond their relationships women have a penchant for sticking their noses into what a man wears from his sporting clothing and clubbing attire to his choice of bathing suit here in australia an entire media subindustry emerged to criticize our former conservative prime minister tony abbott for wearing socalled budgie smugglers whilst swimming and keeping fit
because alan sorrentino had  women obviously stalk his home for his fashion comments should men have stalked the residence of one jennie price a hack journalist from the daily mail  instead of celebrating her husbands decision to resist middleage decline and obesity through cycling price penned a ridiculous piece in  decrying socalled mamils middleaged men in lycra
she joined bbc journalist dominic casciani who equated men taking up the amateur sport with a midlife crisis  notwithstanding that men in lycra wouldnt get i or my readers off at least men wearing this fabric actually engage in exercise when they don it in the morning too when fewer folks are awake to see them by contrast yoga pants seem to be the default female fashion option for nonexercise more than physical exertion or even yoga
naturally had just three guys  let alone  or  made their intention to protestcycle their way through jennie prices neighborhood in britain the police would have been called the same can be said of any of the countless female journalists and female fashion experts who have opined on what men should or should not wear and lets not forget women telling each other what to wear a number of females make their careers out of critiquing what other women wear especially on the celebrity red carpet i wonder how many times for example then zombie and now dead zombie joan rivers found her home marched on by offended feminists after she berated either a piece of female fashion attire or the women wearing it
sending a tweet is violence but  people marching on someones house is notwhat world do we live in the national debt nah terrorism nah urban crime nah these folks are protesting fashion comments
at the start of this year i brought you the story of holly michelle wood  a putrid harvard phd candidate and feminist who went around calling white people awful after the now banned milo yiannopoulos simply retweeted woods criticisms of him fellow feminist catrin cooper used the cyber violence argument and tried to get a twitter stooge michael margolis to alert its founder jack dorsey we would not have the time to go through even a relatively small fraction of the other instances in which women who cannot argue their position online reframe criticism as misogyny or even outright violence
as alan sorrentino clearly feared for his safety during the march potentially hundreds or thousands of women gave themselves excuses for calling some man disagreeing with them online or in person violent a climate now exists where whatever words certain women finds offensive becomes the basis for stopping whatever theyre doing presumably not much and going after the person saying them in the most organized and appalling fashion
at a minimum the target of their fury must lose his job reputation and sense of personal safety to satiate their desire for revenge in the meantime the very act of their protest and abuse which is not interfered with validates the idea that women are not the targets of systematic hate or oppression in society
as a gender women particularly the middle and upper middleclass women who seem to dominate these kinds of pointless abusive protests have nothing to complain about except maybe having too much time on their hands

"home this month popular  things indian guys have to understand when learning game  things indian guys have to understand when learning game february    comments culture 
as a guy of indian ethnicity there are some obstacles you have to overcome in order to have a balanced game circumstances can dictate what these are but following my last post a red pill infused indian pal of mine and myself had a conversation about what these obstacles are  let go of limiting beliefs about being an indian in the western world 
what do i mean by limiting beliefs there is a particular mindset among indian guys that they can only get with indian girls you must let go of these fears dictating that your ethnicity holds you back in what you can do being indian does not mean you have to work in it accounting business construction or own a corner shop as in the same way it does not mean you have to date indian girls  let go of your mummys sari 
its something ive noticed among the large indian community here in london there are a large number of mummys boys men who are afraid to stand up to their mothers and what they want themselves no one wants to disrespect their parents but also at the same time standing up for what you want should be your primary objective many a man will settle with their girlfriends due to pressure from their mothers as one acquaintance said he preempted conflict by just doing what his mother wanted even though he does not love the girl he married  let go and expand beyond your indian comfort zone 
your extended family plays a large part of your life not a bad thing but a lot of guys also have their friends circle exclusively indian expand your knowledge gain new friends travel and learn new languages its a difficult transition to move from becoming over reliant on this little setup to independence from all influence but it can be done and it will benefit your internal well being the thing to remember is you are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with it is highly likely none of your existing five friends will agree with your path into game they will tell what is best for you but in essence this is them subconsciously pulling you back down to their value as you increase your own  stop putting white women on a pedestal 
white women are easy white women are fun white women are flirts white women are great at sex or white women are sluts whatever white women are as an indian guy you must stop putting them on a pedestal for being all these sexually related things that you think indian girls are not there is no magical things that white women do that others do not besides there is not a certain place in the world where white women will see you and jump on your cock as there is not a certain bollywood film that will make a white woman gush all wet and demand you ravage her aryan style white woman pedestalization can be categorized as an inferiority complex displayed by indian men stop thinking youre inferior to any woman regardless of her ethnicracial origins  understand that indian girls are not different and are not more chaste 
being constantly around these indian girls at family gatherings community events and religious events makes you programmed into believing that you will marry one for certain because of their chaste and low promiscuity a strong belief that indian girls dont ride the cock carousel is blind faith because they do in fact all women in the western world do regardless of culture and their strong family traditional values they are women they get pussy tingles to the same game as white black asian orange maroon and kiwi women they have the same subconscious processes as all women that help them place a value on a man and inevitable slamming and spunk gobbling if he passes with flying colors in a western society these girls have the same external pressures and influences that appeal to their inner slut as much as any other woman your objective as a man is not to fall into the line of romantic thinking that they are different  do not be afraid of the man 
theres a man a dominant man somewhere in your family he dictates he dominates and he makes the decisions you have a fear of causing him displeasure you do as he says as hes done the leading since your father emptied his ball sack into your mother stop as much as a lot of indian men have pressures from being mummys little lad theres plenty of them that disintegrate under the pressure of their fathers or uncles avoiding conflict is prevalent in your attitude you do as you are told even though your mind is telling you this is not in your interest and possibly not in the wider interests of those close to you but you do it as uncle or dad has told you to 
no one is telling you to fight but start slowly speak out say what you think is best for you get out of your shell and decide how you will live your life not how dad thinks you should live your life you might be scared of the conflict and dissuade yourself from it but trust me when you finally grow some balls and exude some confidence and ability in yourself these men will respect you see you as equal and place trust in your decisions 
this list could also apply to other cultures who follow similar dynamics to indian culture but dont stop at the above and think thats all you have to doyou still have to hit the ground running and approach just like any other guy learning game",Fake
"anyone whos been involved in the manosphere for long enough knows about the concept of a rite of passage for tens of thousands of years when boys hit the age of puberty they were forced to undergo a set of challenges
these challenges were meant to break them down and build them back up even stronger these challenges were meant to test them as men and they are collectively known as an initiation or as a rite of passage when a boy successfully completed the tasks laid before him he became a man
our society for the most part lacks these rites of passage this is in large part why there is such a lack of masculinity in our culture boys are never given a chance to develop into men we have all of these  year old boyishmen running around for a reason there exists no institutionalized rite of passage in the west
despite this however i believe that learning game is a form of initiation it contains all of the traits necessary to turn a boy into a man it teaches boys to develop selfconfidence  despite what women think of them to become decisive and assertive and to remain persistent and cultivate strength of will
death of the ego 
one of the primary functions of a rite of passage is that it destroys a boys ego this is necessary for in order for him to become a man his identification with boyhood must be destroyed in other words he must cease to view himself as a boy and come to view himself as a man
this is in a nutshell what most of the rites of passage were designed to dothis is why many of them simulated death in a rather bellyofthewhaleesque fashion one rite of passage of the aborigines to be specific entailed kidnapping a young boy from his mother
when a boy would reach the age of puberty the men of the village would sneak into his home during the night and kidnap him his mother would put on a big show screaming and fighting to make it seem realistic the men would blindfold the boy and take him to the middle of the woods
he would then spend the next several months undergoing challenges he would not see a single woman for this period of time this sudden yanking from the motherworld of safety and being thrust into the fatherworld of dangerous challenges symbolized his death as a boy
when the boy returned home he would view himself as a man he would carry himself taller he would interact with the women differently and he would have a new sense of purpose in many ways as i will soon explain game does all of these things for the men willing to learn it
facing fears 
many of these challenges that boys were forced to face involved overcoming their fears fear of death fear of the unknown and fear of failure were all overcome during these rites of passage as an example one native american rite of passage involved making a boy sit blindfolded on a tree trunk for three days straight
imagine his fear as he heard the various animals during the night the howling the cawing and the roaring of the animals alone would be enough to terrify even the bravest of men then add in the elements of cold and wind the bugs that must have crawled over his feet and the fear of a rival tribe member killing him and it becomes very apparent how brave the men of the past must have been
then once three days had passed a man of the village would come and remove the boys blindfold this again is symbolic of his rebirth for three days straight he was blind and helpless then his vision returned and he emerged a new man
all throughout the rites of passage of history whether they be of the inuits the amazon tribes or the south african tribes there are some very common characteristics facing your fear being reborn and coping with uncertainty are all critical parts of these initiations
why were these rituals necessary 
upon contemplation it becomes very clear why these rituals were necessary the world that we live in is radically different than the world that our ancestors lived in a tribe of weak men meant extinction there was no military or safety if the men could not protect the tribe it would not be protected
imagine right now if a marauding band of  vandals roamed into your neighborhood they were all extremely jacked mean looking and each one was carrying some sort of weapon a baseball bat a stick or a crowbar do you think that you and your neighbors would have the balls to fight them off
you being a reader of rok may very well fight a noble fightbut your neighbors i seriously doubt that a purplehaired complaining selfcastrating feminist man would be of any use during a battle such as this
now try to imagine that this sort of thing happened fairly regularly for our ancestors it was not uncommon for neighboring tribes to frequently attack you so it was an absolute necessity that the men be trained for battle but being trained for battle requires more than physical strength
it requires ferocity it requires strength of will decisiveness assertiveness and a complete lack of fear these are the characteristics that rites of passage were meant to breed for without them a tribe would go extinct
are these rituals still necessary 
someone might point out that we arent at war anymore so these rituals arent necessary although i agree that we arent in a state of constant warfare anymore i still believe that these rites of passage are extremely necessary heres why
men and women both have distinct psychological makeups there is no denying this no matter how hard the marxists cry and clamor men and women are different boys have an inherent desire to be a part of something greater than themselves namely a tribe boys have an inherent desire to be welcomed into the world of menand we arent getting it because there isnt even a world of men anymore
the once sacred separation of the genders has been desecrated only a select handful of mens organizations still exist the manosphere the freemasons and various other spiritual organizations it used to be commonplace for gentlemans organizations to exist everywhere but theyve become a thing of the past
this is why in large part were experiencing such a crisis of masculinity men dont know who they are anymore we dont have any healthy male role models all weve got is weak men who justify their weakness with feel good aphorisms we want more but we dont get more
any man who is attuned to this can feel it he can feel the general sense of boyishness that the adulthood of men seems to hold onto theres no chance for us to prove ourselves theres no dragons to slay no enemies to fight off and no fears to overcome
and were suffering we can feel it in our bones not only are men unnecessary but we dont even have opportunities to grow and develop like the men of the past we dont have any initiations or male guidance no men to reassure our belonging in the tribe no obstacles to face
learning game the new initiation 
i believe that although it isnt perfect game is a phenomenal substitute for this lack of a male initiation ritual game provides us with many of the characteristics that you need to be a man and it has many of the characteristics that the old rituals of the past did
destroys your ego requires you to face your fears forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty develops confidence ferocity and a strong will again obviously game isnt perfect one could certainly make the argument that ones masculinity shouldnt be contingent upon what women think and i agree  but do you know what you may get into game for womens approval but any seasoned player knows that you actually stay in the game for your own personal growth
when men first start learning game they get into it because their sex life isnt what they want it to be they think that learning game will get them girls and it does but something happens along the waythey start getting all of the sex that they could ever want and they realize that game has changed them on a deeper level
game provides you with an outlet to overcome your anxiety and to live life fearlessly  by consistently going out and facing your fears of rejection you develop a certain fearless mindset that bleeds into other areas of your life
learning game creates a wholepersonality transformation that cannot be found anywhere else no other hobby outlet or activity will change you as much as game does aside from an actual initiation conducted by the men of the past
game makes you a man 
game will transform you from a boy into a man for a vast number of reasons first off game demolishes your ego  a lot of men have this delusion that they could get any hot girl that they want but they are forced to face reality when they actually go out and try to pull girls
this is why so many men hate game and cant handle it youre forced to face reality very quickly and most men cant take this when you start to go out and learn game you have one of two choices
accept that you suck with girls and keep trying to improve viscerally deny reality and perpetuate your delusions by never going out and experiencing rejection most men choose the latter their ego is far too precious and they cant handle it being challenged those men who do have the courage to demolish their ego however will end up bedding women more gorgeous than they ever imagined take my word for it
second learning game requires you to face your fears think of how many men have approach anxiety nowadays do you think that this underlying anxiety might bleed into other areas of their life of course so once you overcome your approach anxiety in pickup this fearlessness will bleed into other areas of your life in other words youre starting to develop a totally new personality that isnt afraid of living life and taking risks
game forces you to be decisive in times of uncertainty a lot of the time in fact most of the time you dont know whether or not a girls friends will be okay with you you dont know if she has a boyfriend you dont know if she lives nearby you dont know this you dont know that when it comes to game theres a lot of uncertainty
this is why learning game teaches you to accept uncertainty and make take decisive action in the face of it what other skill could be more masculine the men of the past revered this skill because its what their entire livelihood was based around
you see a pack of deer  feet away you dont know if you can kill them or not should you take the risk an enemy tribe is attacking should you run to your hut and get a better weapon or pick up a rock and do what you can youre injured and alone but you see a nearby village should you ask them for help would they kill you or heal you
learning to take decisive action in the face of uncertainty was a skill that every man had for millenia his life depended on it now the only way to cultivate this skill is through game or other more extreme measures such as fighting in a war or something although even then you wont have much freedom to make decisions
all in all game will take you from a boy to a man it will teach you to be confident and to become completely detached from either rejection or acceptance from women it will help you to develop assertiveness and social calibration
most importantly however it will teach you to overcome your fears in the words of my favorite pickup mentor learning game is an odyssey of the mind it teaches you to overcome your fears to face your lingering negative beliefs and to grow as a man our society gives us no right of passage so weve created our own go out and learn game for it will change your life

"lately gunfree zones and gun control laws are all the rage among the globalists and liberals of all shapes usually circular and sizes 
those measures solely aimed at disarming the people and depriving them of the sacred right to defend themselves has shown its vast ineffiency with gun victims and terrorist attacks on the rise in those zones since no honest citizen can shoot back to stop the massacre
here is why i propose once a conservative government reaches the white house to create fat control laws fcl and obesityfree zones ofz as obesity is indeed a more serious threat to the lives of americans than honest citizens carrying legally purchased guns here are six potential benefits
 simple philanthropy 
obese people are delusional thinking that it is great to be a useless sack of shit nowadays they get fed a distorted reality saying that big and round is beautiful when the natural reaction deeply branded in our dna is disgust mockery and suspicion
fat and sedentary lifestyles kill much more than guns  the war against obesity is as important as the war on crime or drugs bovine people not only harm themselves but others too by creating measures to prevent them from becoming fat or exhorting them lose weight we are helping our common man to preserve his dignity as a human being
in their case sugar and salt create a dopamine rush and an addiction loop very similar to an addiction to opiates we must show our potbellied or barrelbellied junkies the way as they cant take the steps themselves
just like with restrictions on cigarettes if they are stupid enough to gorge themselves on calories we must conclude that there is a severe lack of judgement on their part and prevent them from purchasing the source of their misery
 preserving aesthetics and other senses 
no more eyesore of seeing fatties rolling around everywhere you go imagine a beach with a plethora of more feminine attractive and thin women by banning whales in bikinis
our nostrils would also be free of the olfactory offence that they throw in our faces say goodbye to the pungent smell of fat rolls sweat at your local grocery store
no more lb sjw land whales with laboured breath sounds in waiting rooms or uncontrolled farting in the public transport like you are in a cattle train it could be tomorrow
 positive impact on children 
i do not want these people to roam free and that my future progeny can witness it and think that this is normal worse if the pc politburo tells them it is beautiful to be a beached whale lets send them far until they get better out of sight out of mind as they say
legal elements should be implemented against pernicious publicity aired on television and directly aimed at children whether by the time chosen to air it or the promotion it makes of unhealthy eating
of course with fat control policies kids will get bullied at school some will cut themselves for being called fattie so what adapt and overcome or crawl in a ball and cry the weakest has to be left behind if he does not want to save himself
 a healthier population you are under arrest for being an immovable gargantuan arsehole
fat is not a silent killer hundreds of thousands of people die with a loud thud every year of obesityrelated diseases a largely preventable cause of death worldwide today  in  americans and  in  britons dies from being a fat arse with no selfcontrol
it is a fact that obesity causes death by cardiac arrest diabetes coronary and liver diseases cancer and hypertension among others promoting a healthy lifestyle and physical activity will create a longer life expectancy
physically healthier people are mentally healthier too boost of selfesteem and confidence fat control laws will reduce mental health issues such as depression inferiority complex or suicidal tendencies caused by obesity that is also less money spent by the taxpayer
 a boost for the economy 
according to a  report ham planets cost the economy  billion a year  and that is for the american economy alone the number of human cattle is still growing exponentially it inflicted more than a  billion loss to the economy in 
in  we can reasonably assume that the number of obese people has grown and has impacted the wallet of your average american even harder
a fitter population with its nutritional choices would result in a more natural higherquality food industry smaller amounts of food produced and needed resulting in reduced resources and materials wasted during and after its production
we could see the end of excessive fossil fuel used to transport land walruses and their fat arse across long distances and hogging the space that could be use by three normal individuals
healthier more active people are happier more productive and successful since the cogs of the machinery are not coated in fat an age of stronger selfgoverned highenergy men bringing a healthier society its yuge
 a new sexual and romantic market 
it will bring a more balanced sexual arena to limit the accumulation of fat a radical answer to the phenomenon of plummeting testosterone levels caused by high fat percentage trimming the numbers of plump omegas and sexual market voluntary rejects
lets impose a healthier diet for higher numbers of attractive thin and pretty women greater numbers of quality girls to choose from reduces aggressive competition which decreases the bitch shields of thin entitled girls
endless supplies of betas queuing to capture crumbs of their attention would be a thing of the past as i said it before male thirst is the root of all evil when it comes to romantic competition
sexier citizens means more relationships a peak in libido and reproduction of physically and mentally balanced individual helping nations suffering from low birth rate
one more element for the protection of western society being the most affected one and its people cementing the bases of a strong future fighting globalism and the myth they try to sell us about global overpopulation
by logical natural process bronies corpulent manchildren and manga conventions should also disappear soon
the fat control laws  segregated obesityfree zones 
our diabetic mammoths must be isolated from further propaganda and tasty treats
this is why we should create large very large fenced areas to protect the healthy subjects as fat is more dangerous than guns
lets pen the bigboned rejects in separated zones where access to junk food and other harmful products would be forbidden fresh water open spaces salad and treadmills as far as the eye could see
build that fence
we shall call it the david fatrelle center for porcine rehabilitation
 permits 
a permit would have to be issued similar to a guncarrying permit for the purchase of junk food highcarb snacks soda drinks etc after a doctors physical exam of the patient slim citizens would be delivered a permit with a stamp of approval granting them access to supermarkets or venues where processed or junk food is served
 mandatory workouts 
compulsory exercise would be imposed to obese people to reach a standard bmi we could bring it up a notch where a fine could be issued after a determined period of time if the weight loss target has not been reached
a steps counter activity tracker would have to be worn or installed on their smartphone and a quota of physical activity would have to be reached on a day to day basis
just like the programs for convicted criminals or drug abusers with reports to the local police station on a regular basis the stubbornly chunky would be followed during a rehabilitation stage and their progress monitored

fat people are a dead weight to society in all senses of the term and to compensate this burden they must chip in one way or another and repair the harm they cause
fitter people means a selfaware powerful mass that strives for greatness
but the liberals in charge dont want that this is why they produce massive amounts of harmful processed food and encourage the pleb by manipulating publicity and promoting makebelieve to remain fat weak and above all docile
its all part of a plan fat control laws are the answer to that great evil

" more emotions men should master  more emotions men should master 
andrÃ© is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   mind 
passions and emotions are an almost bottomless pit start digging there and you will find new ones or new relations between this and that tidbit of emotional content socalled enlightenment philosophers who tried to theorize the passionssomething that had been done at greater length actually by thomas aquinascould never agree on how many there were or even how much they exactly mattered in the course of life 
whether or not you have been reading my last two pieces on the topic remember this is about mastering passions in the most general sense this is not only about emotional restraint or seduction our own emotional states are the first in line but mastering the passions is also about spotting what other people are feeling how they can be led to a specific course of action and what tends to make them tick mastering the passions is far from evident it rather takes times and experience the concepts and directions i am providing here aim at giving some conscious clarity about things that are by nature a bit muddy 
artists though they often suffer from mental problems are skilled at painting a particular vision in vivid colours allowing their public to share a specific point of view and emotional state this is something the elite know very well critics trashed ayn rands atlas shrugged because they could see themselves painted there as passiveaggressive cultural parasites rands novel was more cogent and attracted more heat than her barely original philosophical pieces today sold at the cheapest price on the secondhand book market 
more recently the movie the fall  got backlashed by some of the mainstream media on the grounds that it depicted hitler as too human while seeing actor bruno ganz pondering eating talking to his closest company or getting angry the viewer could perhaps feel a bit of empathy to him which is of course unacceptable to a left that clings to the idea of a crazy careless inhuman dictator to be forever cast as an embodiment of evil hollywood directors do not like witnessing others competing with their own emotional mastery 
we need artists as well as qualified cultural critics to take some distance from the mainstream propaganda disguised as entertainment and expand an alternative culture and artworks emotions explored in the present series can be used just that way  gratitude 
gratitude denotes a trained and refined disposition being graceful means recognizing that the good in our life can come from something that is outside us and outside our control neel burton heaven and hell  chap p it focuses on positive things we already have and that cannot be ascribed to our sole merit or efforts 
the traditional world whatever the particular cultural or religious form it was embodied into always emphasized the necessity of being grateful you owed your existence to god to your family and your community none of these goods were actually deserved which meant you had to be grateful for them and repay them by being a dutiful member of the community as well as a dutiful father for your own children a lot of prayers and ancient rites imply a thanksgiving for what one already has 
moving later in time it is striking to see that modern progressivism breeds the exact opposite mindset the ideology of rights make many goods granted not a thank you for but an i have a right to neophilia the relentless pursuit of novelty always casts a bad shadow on what has been around for some time as if what was coming later was always better 
advertisement gossip culture economic growth pressure quest for victimhood lead to envy and always being more or less frustrated with what one already has regardless of what it is by leading us to always want more progressivism makes us oblivious to what we already have or how it does not stem from pure individual meritand when it flatters the ego it makes us complacent and far from cultivating the art of being thankful 
turning our backs from the modern ungraceful mindset is easier said than done to start with loudmouthed girls should be remembered they owe their nice luxurious workplaces to the men who built them lgbtbbq should thank their heterosexual parents and ancestors for their very lives antiwhite black activists should remember they would not even exist had their ancestors not benefited from their white colonizers healthcare technology feel free to expand the list ultimately i think every person who is modern or westernized enough can be outed as ungraceful for something  trust 
a famous study showed that multiculturalism was closely correlated with defiance and a lack of trust in each other provided that we enlarge a bit our definition of multiculturalism this absolutely makes sense some ethnic groups are especially prone to violence and some minority groups are rewarded for freely accusing the silent majority but the hegemony of political correctness made it a taboo communities have been fragmented by individualism ie each person looking to take as much as she can and by an antiracist white guilt that soon became an intrawhite generalized suspicion of racism people do not identify anymore with the larger society and often cannot even identify with a smaller communitywhich makes everyone else a potential enemy 
yet without trust life becomes unbearable if you cant go to the streets without the possibility of getting mugged by say blm activists  or go to a family meal without the prospect of a lukewarm struggle with aging leftist parents or have a relationship with a girl without the possibility of her making a false rape accusation  there arent a lot of things you can do on the long run without trust in other people you have to trust the complex of big corporations ngo and state institutions we call the systemand be dependent from it for things as basic as food and shelter 
only trust in each other can make life sustainable and longterm projects workable to recreate trust we have to make people accountable and bound to precise rules reward good behaviours while punishing bad ones actions must bear consequences but before neomasculinity gets into power men should strive to establish a reputation through reliability persistence and a strong mindset i could wager you have been more trusting of your facebook friends last years than of the mainstream media  the former conveying more trustworthy information than the latter  desire 
modern capitalism and progressivism always ran on desire want cheaper prices more goods better goods more tv channels to watch more monies more ego and thinking you are the hot shit well just buy in x or do some work for y and here it is um nah you just have to do some more and some more and some more in the end you forgot why exactly you are doing what youre doing or why you started to watch tv but it all started with you led to perform something no matter how surreptitiously framed as spontaneous or normal it was 
the system plays on desires in three ways it sets things to be desired things to be feared or never desired at all and things to be consummated without end things to be desired include everything the advertisement wants you to desire like a revolving credit a new sofa an suv or whatever as well as the next step of  progress  as it has been elaborated on the top of the pyramid 
things to be feared are where the system wants you to be resigned and fatalistic did you ever feel sad to see all these girls losing themselves into a sea of fat bitching and sjwpropaganda spouting too bad thats globalization resistance is futile move on at last things to be consummated are mainly produced to keep you busy and programmed though you are not really practising anything beyond staring at a screen 
lately an important shift has been happening between the first and third ways to play on desires decades before the average consumer had to desire owning more junk or being part of the progress the system needed him to work and monitor his peers today the junk is already everywhere pc culture is already hegemonic and the average american worker is no longer needed active desire is not needed anymore 
thus the system has shifted into making the average joe more passive instead of actually desiring more the consumer should be content with surrogates of everythingpseudogroup identity with team sports pseudosports with football and basket on tv pseudosex with porn pseudolife with video games pseudofamily life with animals pseudoexpertise when the average libtard obnoxiously parrots the media on everything this is brzezinskis tittytainment in a nutshell 
even if you dont give up on having a real life instead of a surrogate the system will still want you to desire things only for yourself thus retreating into individualism instead of trying to actually weight on the world either you surrender to the progress or you try to ignore it before it comes for you as if nothing could change 
dont let the elite frame the world according to its own interests desire selfrealization and weighting on the course of the world of course our female counterparts should desire being loving caretaking and definitely on our side to conclude this series 
once again it is hard to sketch in a few words what could be done with passions or emotions what i have mostly dwelled into is how those already in power manipulate them and what we could do as to take them back if you find the topic worthy of interest you can expand it in two directions first documenting yourself on a particular passion or emotion and second using some by stirring it with a certain aim in mind 
in the former case i would recommend neel burtons heaven and hell quoted several times in the course of this series as a point of departure in the latter being creative or simply assertive is up to you whether this looks more like efforts or selfpersuasion or artistry does not matter much 
here as well as in seduction a tight framing is key whatever the topic no vocabulary and no picture are really neutral which is a problem as our perception and thinking orientation are often conditioned by these the mastery of emotions is reinforcedand reinforcesthe mastery of representations if this sounds farfetched let me provide some examples of use examples you are absolutely free to expand as it suits you 
in the comments space several guys here have been giving a very negative portrayal of the nice guy he would be a fake a sneaky bastard a jerk so guys who want to get laid or have their own interests just as everyone else are jerks this looks like internalized feminist thinking in my opinion nice guys should elicit empathy which goes through a positive portrayal emphasizing their willingness to respect the girl or how they were likely raised by an unmanly culture 
a recent rok piece about mainstream media has shown how these are making a conscious effort to hide and delegimitate white victimhood they paint vividly any crime where the victim is nonwhite and the perpetrator is but mention no detail or do not mention at all any crime perpetrated by nonwhites on whites 
the same pattern appears in the movie elysium  when the of course white villain mentions children she wants to protect from a mass of brown invaders yet these children are never shown and consequently stir no empathy from the average watcher whereas the brownskinned are vividly depicted as humane and not responsible for their own poverty 
analyzing these phenomena is fine but ultimately insufficient creative people on our side have to provide an alternative that includes mastered emotions picking up girls is part of and gives some experience in this wider game",Fake
"the following post was sponsored by chad cocker and written by matt forney 
everyone says that you shouldnt judge a book by its cover but thats really difficult when the cover makes you throw up a little in your mouth thats how i felt when i was tasked with writing a review of chad t cockers memoirs of a misogynist an erotic novel for men  what kind of man would want to read an erotic novel romance and erotica are female masturbation material trying to write a harlequin novel men is like marketing lesbian porn to actual lesbians
or so i thought
despite the packaging memoirs of a misogynist is one of the best works ive read this year contrary to cockers marketing the novel is a examination of life as a man in modern america filtered through the protagonists relationships with women while it starts slowly cockers prose and honesty save the day and make memoirs of a misogynist absolutely worth your time and money
from the marquis de sade to neomasculinity 
because mainstream publishing almost exclusively caters to women underground and independent writers have turned to fill the void of malecentric literature from braggadocios fratire writers like tucker max and maddox to loser lit authors such as andy nowicki and ann sterzinger to our very own roosh and quintus curtius theres a surfeit of alternative writing for men who are sick of the misandry and feminism of the real literary world
viewed against the backdrop of alternative publishing memoirs of a misogynist is an odd animal indeed when i first picked it up i assumed it would be a tellall memoir along the lines of rooshs a dead bat in paraguay or a roman Ã  clef in the fashion of charles bukowskis work however it does indeed live up to its subtitle as much of the novel is devoted to lengthy detailed descriptions of the protagonists sexual encounters
shed also gotten used to her chastity belt and that scared her it still didnt sit well with her that master had total control over her sexual gratification slave was constantly wet and horny and that made her even more compliant the orgasms that master gave her were unlike anything she had experienced before they were mindblowing even after a year together their sex was electric and deeply satisfying
in the introduction cocker warns us that the book is possibly the dirtiest most depraved and most offensive novel youve ever read making me wonder if hes ever heard of  days of sodom still the structure of memoirs plot and the skill of cockers prose shows that hes both acquainted with classic erotica and has actually had sex with a lot of girls the first half of the book is reminiscent of pauline reages story of o in which a woman is systematically trained to become a sex slave
interestingly memoirs of a misogynist also seems inspired by venus in furs not the velvet underground song but the erotic novel by leopold von sachermasoch its from sachermasoch that we derive the term masochism the tendency to derive sexual pleasure from pain akin to how sadism is derived from sade as the plot revolves around a man who desires nothing more than to be utterly subservient to his mistress severins humiliation at the hands of his lover drives him to become a misogynist in the same way that cockers protagonist is one
that woman as nature has created her and man at present is educating her is mans enemy she can only be his slave or his despot but never his companion this she can become only when she has the same rights as he and is his equal in education and work
its worth noting that sachermasoch was a feminist and believed that equal relationships with women would only become possible with womens liberation insert your own joke here
power doesnt care what you need as long as youre on your knees 
enjoying memoirs of a misogynist requires you to get past the initial few chapters which read like fifty shades of grey with about  extra iq points the initial plot concerns melinda a runaway who falls into the care of a wealthy man who goes unnamed for most of the book after offering her room and board the man and melinda begin a relationship sealed by a contract where she agrees to become his sexual plaything
my body is my masters it is his blank canvas for him to modify as many times and in as many different ways as he chooses he could hear her breath quickening as he read he will control my bodily functions most particularly my orgasms i will only orgasm when my master allows me 
what saves the bookand what kept me readingwas its depiction of the protagonist henceforth referred to as master far from the masturbatory blank slate that christian grey was cocker depicts master as a complex and conflicted character constantly trying to rationalize the way he treats melinda later rechristened slave cockers deft writing kept me wondering what the protagonists motivations were all the way to the end the book also frequently switches to melindas perspective while its usually a challenge for male writers to depict female characters and vice versa cocker is skilled enough to make her compelling as well
where memoirs really picks up is in the second half which is set nearly ten years later the focus shifts to elizabeth avery a disgraced doctor stripped of her medical license after shes caught abusing a male patient destitute and despondent she accepts a job as the personal physician of masters stable of whores his lifestyle offending her feminist sensibilities
doctor averys world was spinning she tried to distance herself this was just a patient after all she was being paid a significant amount of money for this jobthe kind of money that would solve a lot of her problems regardless she couldnt help but be disgusted that a woman had allowed herself to be treated this way hed said she consented to this in fact the way she looked at the man showed she clearly loved him and was a willing participant in her modifications and degradation the woman or melinda as the man had called her looked up at him with what the doctor could only call adoration
once again it would have been easy for cocker to depict elizabeth as a raging braburning feminist stereotype but he agilely avoids clichÃ©s in favor of nuance elizabeth isnt portrayed as a firebreathing misandrist but as a woman who unthinkingly absorbs leftist cant and has her life ruined because of it the final chapters of the book show elizabeth tussling with the sexual arousal she feels working for mr x her name for the protagonist and her attempts to maintain her beliefs as the evidence of her failed life piles up i wont spoil the ending other than to say that after finishing the book i had to sit on it and digest it for a few days
each chapter of memoirs begins with a factual statistic about the state of men and boys in america today a jarring contrast with the depravity of the books action i initially wondered why they were there but as i approached the end of the book it all suddenly clicked memoirs of a misogynist is a biting look at what our toxic sexual marketplace does to men and women american dating is like an acid bath no one who dives into it comes out unscathed even men who are successful at getting laid are affected by what they have to do to get ahead there are no winners no saints and no role models just people trying to make the best of a broken system
as i stated earlier memoirs takes a while to really get going and if youre not into lascivious descriptions of sex the book wont appeal to you but if you want a haunting piercing look at the horror show of modern gender relations memoirs of a misogynist is a mustbuy i cant wait to see what cocker comes up with next

"home this month popular  tips for having sex with croatian girls  tips for having sex with croatian girls february    comments travel day game 
 croatian girls are extremely receptive to day game they want to be opened even if she has headphones and seems focused on her music it can still go well same goes for girls on rollerblades excuse me where can i buy rollerblades like yours 
 croatia is one of those places where both indirect and direct game work pick one that suits the venue and your personality what i did was open indirect chat for a couple minutes and then hit her with a compliment about her positive energy to see how shed respond if she smiled i knew i was in 
 girls will give you their number even if they have a boyfriend it may not come out until the first meeting to avoid this when i was getting a number id jokingly say youre not married right if she had a boyfriend she would then announce it with a guilty look on her face 
 always go for the instadate especially if youre doing street game not only will this weed out flakey girls but it gives you an opportunity to find out what she wants in life croatia has a lot of good girls who dont drink at all and want a serious relationship you want to dump those prospects if youre not staying long 
 a common issue youll find on the first date is girls who want to bring their friends along dont let them or youll get stuck in a hellish group chat its either a on date or nothing night game 
 you need to push the interaction as far as you can go if you dont at least get a kiss the odds that number will lead to a date is  or less if you get a passionate kiss with some handholding at the end over  its easy to get a number from a croatian girl but you should resist push for the kiss its similar to what you should do in america 
 absolutely do not add a croatian girl to facebook they are accomplished attention whores and will string you along if you didnt at least get a phone number you got nothing 
 cockblocking is a huge problem the best way to fight it is to be more selective about the venues you choose large clubs have the hottest girls but they are harder to approach and you will end up getting cockblocked incessantly hipster bars have the ugliest girls but youll rarely get cockblocked experiment in the city to find something in the middle that has the best balance between beauty and attitude so much of a successful croatian experience will be based on the venue going from the best venue to the worst you may even feel like youre in a different country as a general rule if youre in a club where the girls arent genuinely excited youre a foreigner you should go somewhere else 
 since so many girls go out in pairs its better to roll with a wingman than solo dolo a problem youll face if you re going out solo is that a girl doesnt want to leave her friend alone what i did was approach girls whose friend was already getting hit on by another guy 
 dont compliment at night  croatian girls already have an elevated perception of themselves and get compliments all the time they are not insecure as girls from the baltics or ukraine  
 dont call a girl before you bang her they rarely answer text instead 
 croatia is slowly embracing onenight stands with the right logistics you should be able to get them they are far easier than a place like ukraine the key here is having tight logistics it should be so tight that you can take a walk with her and be at your place to hop in for a quick drink the girls who are most likely to go for this will be  and who want a taste of the american sexual culture older women will be able to resist your logistical game 
 similar to the above point all your dates should be close to your apartment if your date venue is more than half a mile away youre already shooting yourself in the foot even if a croatian girl is playing aloof she can turn on a dime once in a private room 
 the less snobby the club the more acceptable it is to buy a girl a drink without getting punished for it croatia isnt like other eastern european countries where girls are generally upfront and honest with their intentionsthey will play you if you give them the opportunity especially the higher end venues generally speaking as long as she didnt have a bitch face when you first approached her you should be in the clear to buy a drink  
 the best game for zagreb the capital is to have the best logistics possible sadly croatian girls flake more than average so you want the proximity of your apartment to act as bait for casual hangouts that turn into bangs unless youre dealing with an older croatian girl who is into you youll have to play the numbers game and not get hung up on any one girl get ready to meet some hardcore female players 
 if you put x hours a day into day game and x hours into night game youll be rewarded with night game first you can get surprisingly fast bangs at night that day game doesnt provide mostly because aggressive night game easily screens out day girls who are simply bored but not really hankering for dick if i go back to croatia ill just move right next to a good bar",Fake
"by day i work in a scrap yard it is not glamorous but glamour does not pay my bills in the evening i teach in a welding program at a community college
like many others i once bought into the fallacy that you need a piece of paper from a university to succeed in life at the age of thirty i graduated from a university with an undergraduate degree and the customary debt which came along with it twentynine years later i see how wrong i was
soon after graduating i obtained an office job and moved to a city where i knew no one the job i was so optimistic about turned out to be like marriage to a crack whore each day was as if walking through a minefield full of dysfunctional women emasculated men drama backstabbing catfights and every other problem associated with modern workplaces worse yet the cut male managers allowed trim to be in charge resulting in a fucked up toxic culture after three tumultuous and abusive years i found myself unceremoniously kicked to the curb and surprisingly relieved
after a lengthy stint of unemployment i landed an entrylevel job in a metal fabrication company one of the benefits offered was tuition reimbursement for work related classes i enrolled in welding classes at night and upgraded my skills all on my employers dime
i immediately noticed a difference from my previous job i worked exclusively with men except for a few token assholes the men liked their solitude did their jobs and left each other alone the work was varied creative and with overtime the pay was decent the fact that i had a work ethic showed up every day on time and desired to learn earned me respect quickly
i eventually went down a different path but returned to welding parttime as an adjunct instructor
welding is the joining of two metal pieces or parts by applying heat a filler metal or electrode helps to make the joint power source supplies electricity required for heat and a shielding gas or fluxcovered electrode aids in the welding process
the most common welding processes are gas metal arc welding gmaw flux core arc welding fcaw gas tungsten arc welding gtaw and shielded metal arc welding smaw of these gas metal arc welding is the easiest to learn and offers the fastest production welding involves both ferrous steel and nonferrous metals aluminum stainless steel
why welding  according to a bureau of labor report the need for welders will grow by  percent by 
 according to a national association of manufacturers report nearly  percent of manufacturers in the united states report that they cannot find skilled welders to meet demand
 the american welding society reports that the average age for a welder is now in the midfifties
 entrylevel wages in my region average  annually with skilled welders earning  and more after five years in the trade
i frequently hear from employers who are desperate for skilled welders one plant manager told me there are too many computer jockeys and not enough people who can weld and turn a wrench another manufacturer told me we have over a dozen welders retiring and no one to replace them further the school i teach at has more jobs available than they have students enrolled
what welders do welders work in manufacturing construction maintenance repair facilities and service companies welders typically work eighthour shifts and a fiveday week but overtime is common welders often perform other duties like operating metal fabrication equipment and doing assembly work
the more skills a welder develops the more value and earning potential he has for example being able to weld cut and fit up metals and read weld symbols and prints will command a higher wage becoming certified in certain weld procedures also increases a welders wages and marketability
qualifications 
welding is the quintessential bluecollar job it is physically demanding hot dirty and requires a high degree of skill other personal characteristics are good eyesight and hand eye coordination good manual dexterity and good concentration
training community colleges offer affordable training for entrylevel jobs in welding most programs are nine months but my school also offers a sixteenweek work ready certificate in welding students learn common welding processes thermal cutting processes and blueprint reading unlike the typical ivory palace college professors instructors are required to have a minimum of three years related and verifiable industrial experience job placement is also good
additional facts 
despite a decent paying skill in high demand clueless parents and educators continue to dissuade young men from entering bluecollar trades like welding the result has been an entire generation of young men ruined by hostile fouryear colleges worthless degrees and insurmountable debt
perhaps you are a perceptive and bright young rok reader considering a career change in closing consider these facts
 you will always have employment as a welder
 welding skills are highly transferable you can carry these skills to your next and often higher paying job
 unlike many whitecollar corporate jobs of today the average welders wages increase with skill overtime merit increases and production bonuses are common benefits for welders
 at the end of your shift you can leave your job at the door
 welding offers a level of creativity solitude and seeing the fruits of your labor studies show that welders machinists and other bluecollar trades have lower suicide rates than many whitecollar professions
 welding is often a gateway trade into other even higher paying trades like machinist multicraft machinery maintenance and millwright
 welding is a male dominated occupation traditionalist men will find it offers some insulation and respite from the typical feminist diatribe and pc bullshit of todays corporate world
conclusion how has welding benefited me first i developed reasoning skills something that academia failed to do i also developed a thorough understanding of how men do the dirty nasty and dangerous jobs in this life feminists and elitists can marginalize men all they want but men risk their lives and health to build and maintain their shit
further welding has opened some doors for me mainly teaching my ultimate goal is to teach welding fulltime a late life career change if you will and one i hope will happen

"the importance of patriarchal religion to marriage and childrearing the importance of patriarchal religion to marriage and childrearing brutus centinel 
brutus centinel is an american christian patriarch leading a family resistance to the decline because guns are libertys teeth brutus is a firearms enthusiast and a militia officer brutus fights to help americans across the political spectrum wake up to the tyranny of our corporate overloads november   religion 
i live in america and i am happily married with kids i do not write this because i am more manly or intelligent or successful than you i am not i write this to share the main key to my success patriarchal traditional religion 
i am writing from my own religious convictions which i believe are true you are free to disagree but you may still find value here i have read the writings of other religions and consider them true myths useful for their wisdom even though i may disagree with their theology neomasculinity itself is a philosophy that can be accepted by people of different religions or no religion modern religion ill find another church thanks 
modern religion is a feminized wasteland god exists to impose obligations on men and excuses womens evil acts faith is blind irrational and collectivist 
men hate modern religion which is why most churches in the west are demographically imbalanced toward women men are bored to death with touchyfeely sermons endless committee meetings female gossip and the losers sitting in the pews around them this is not how it should be patriarchal religion thats more like it 
patriarchal religion is interesting to men it teaches that god is a man creator of rationality slayer of evil men protector of the innocent praise be to the lord my rock who trains my hands for war my fingers for battle psalm  
in maleled churches women are taught to be respectful to their fathers husbands and legitimate authority they understand that their role is to raise and care for children and support their husbands mission wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the lord ephesians  
in patriarchal religion female sins like rebellion envy dishonesty hypergamy dressing and acting like a whore and hamstering or rationalizing sin are condemned when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it genesis  i also want the women to dress modestly with decency and propriety adorning themselves not with elaborate hairstyles or gold or pearls or expensive clothes but with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship god  timothy  and adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner  timothy  this is the way of an adulterous woman she eats and wipes her mouth and says ive done nothing wrong proverbs  finding a virtuous woman this is the unicorn i married 
all women are tempted towards sins like envy but not all women act on their impulses in spite of what many observe in the west i have met many virtuous women few sexual partners before marriage respectful submissive to their husbands physically fit feminine good mothers most are in the older generations especially before the boomers most are involved in traditional religion there are fewer younger women who are virtuous and every single one that i have met is involved in traditional religion they tend to be more rural from small churches 
traditional religion can be extremely helpful to finding and vetting women it provides a community with certain values that you want in a woman and it provides reliable references for a persons character a woman who spent her younger years out in the world and came back at  be a bornagainvirgin is a red flag but a woman in her early s who teaches sunday school and helps with the potluck dinners is far more likely to be wife material the older women in the church will usually let you know if a woman is a whore patriarchal religion helps control womens sinful tendencies with proper training woman can be virtuous 
traditional religion acts as a curb but not a cure for womens immoral rebellious destructive behavior my wife goes to a womens bible study group where she often receives instruction from older religious women this includes things like telling her to be submissive to me lose weight and be healthy not waste money have cheerful sex on a regular basis and to learn how to get some control over her emotions teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine but to teach what is good then they can urge the younger women to love their husbands and children to be selfcontrolled and pure to be busy at home to be kind and to be subject to their husbands titus  
one of my wifes friends once corrected her attitude toward sex saying you need to view your body as a sheath for your husbands sword she now routinely thanks me after we have sex i am not a natural alpha but i have little fear that my wife is going to suddenly cut off sex if i have a minor slip up band of brothers weve got your back bro deus vult 
with this great power comes great responsibility as a patriarch i am commanded to lead my family instructing my wife and kids on how to act properly with genuine love for their wellbeing i must be on top of my game be physically fit and think rationally when my wife is irrational i attend a mens bible study where we talk about leading as men every man in my group owns a gun and we often go shooting together 
we encourage support teach and correct each other i have had sharp intense discussions with my pastor and men in my church about my own character and life decisions things are handled like men discussed in the open with realtalk not rhetorical bullshit and masculine love and concern for each other this has aided me in thinking deeply about my life and correcting bad decisions i have made 
awhile back we helped another man who was on the verge of divorce he was working  hours a week because he would not stand up to his employer and had no energy to lead his family we told him that the marriage counseling he was getting was bullshit talk about your feelings more and that his slavish attitude toward his employer was making his wife lose respect for him the women in our church also talked to his wife about choosing to be respectful and submissive in spite of her rebellious emotions 
he cut back hours at work which enabled him able to be captain of his ship again this along with training his wife received helped her become more respectful now his wife is less of a bitch and they have sex several times a week i doubt this would have happened without patriarchal religion children ive succeeded as a father 
we see that our culture is toxic feminized and immoral men need a place to raise children apart from these toxins and church is a great place to do this my kids go to sunday school classes where they are taught to be respectful to me my wife and legitimate adult authorities we have several families with welldisciplined children that we can trust wont corrupt our kids my wife often takes the kids for playdates so she can socialize with wholesome women which is a great alternative to sitting around on social media all day conclusion patriarchal traditional religion will not change female nature but it can help restrain it this is how past generations maintained civilization i can confidently say that traditional religion is the main reason i can maintain a happy marriage in this cesspool of a culture those who are not religious might consider other institutions that may provide similar support for their marriage and childraising",Fake

globalism and cultural marxism are the driving forces behind population replacement policies but unawareness and apathy are almost as much of a problem  some think that if western civilization will go down the toilet they should just go with the flow and enjoy the ride all the way down the tubes thanks to media propaganda and educational indoctrination they have no idea that their own civilization is worth anything and dont have the slightest concern for their own posterity still theyre pretty naive to believe that things cant turn far worse within their own lifetimes why this is bad for those who need reminding in the future is this going to get better or worse 
if trends continue unabated the founding peoples will lose control over their destiny history shows that when this happens the results are not good pillaging and plundering is a more genteel affair in modern times though not always  but youre still not going to like it will your new rulers say since things have changed so much how about we abolish affirmative action and setasides to show weve transcended race dont count on it more likely theyll double down on these preferential treatment programs and come up with new ones and you will have no chance to block the spoils systems 
thats just the beginning too the  diversification  of cities for the last several decades has been baddetroit need i say moreand riots really are getting out of hand now imagine what it will be like when you have no hope of influencing things like section  housing moving into your neighborhood or if youll get any real police protection 
this is what were facing if the aztlÃ¡n crowd takes over the southwest the community agitators get in charge of the big cities and together their constituency has an electoral majority controlling the federal government also remember that theyve been told since the s that youre evil oppressors responsible for all their problems parts of flyover country might be able to hold out for a while but nothing short of forming their own country will stop the advance of progress if it were ever to come to secession theyll be surrounded outnumbered and outgunned lets keep things from getting to that point is there any hope refugees have taken on the characteristics of invaders 
ive painted a grim picture but i have to be realistic as for what will happen later things only look worse jean raspails camp of the saints describes a bleak future like that this isnt just the usa on the line but western europe too and perhaps eastern europe and australia in time if we want to keep from disappearing into the endless night the time to act is now 
sometimes with luck sovereignty can be regained for example the spanish reconquista or the nations of the balkans rising after a few centuries under the turkish yoke however the results arent guaranteed some nations may never recover in these examples the dhimmis were subjugated under military occupation but they were not outnumbered in their own lands the founding populations must not allow themselves to be dispossessed in their own countries in the first place 
granted the dark forces of globalism are very powerfuland theyd like us to think theyre invinciblebut they must be stopped they also want you to think theyre smarter than you and know whats good for you  if theyd simply focus on getting richer and cease their social engineering theyd have far less to answer for not only has our political establishment failed us theyre working against the public  it wont be easy but we must reassert control over our destiny do we deserve to be dispossessed brainwashed sjws welcoming their own destruction 
some will even sayoften with haughty condescensionthat if we lose our countries then we deserve this fate ignoring for a moment the sheer snottiness as well as the might makes right argument incongruent with the usual rhetoric of fairness by the prepare to be assimilated resistance is futile crowd lets consider the following facts in the s a communist propaganda campaign was launched in the western world in the s this mutated into cultural marxism and kicked into high gear during the s most people have no idea of the scope of it all or where things like political correctness came from only senior citizens remember what it was like living in a fairly normal country even fewer never grew up exposed to this propaganda in one form or another the rest of us have been indoctrinated from an early age by the mass media and educational establishment the western political tradition lately is about openness and democracy for this reason we dont conduct political change by torches and pitchforks these days we play fair even if our enemies often dont  further political correctness encourages the disadvantaged to have solidarity but vilifies the same in the majority this is one reason why were on the defensive and for now usually losing most people only have a vague idea about the extent of managed democracy and sheer corruption those against population replacement policies mostly put their faith in the mainstream opposition parties not realizing that theyve sold out to deeppockets globalists too mainstream conservatism is a controlled opposition  providing token resistance at best 
so with that extent of treachery disinformation limited options for resistance and managed democracy its grotesquely dishonest for the defeatists to tell us that were losing a fair fight as for their opinion that we should just give up i have one word no 
whenever you hear the defeatists crowing that this is inevitable or that we deserve it remember that they want to demoralize you and anyone else listening the same goes for when they tell you that loving your people and wanting your posterity to survive is hatred suppose someone is losing his home by a devious swindle orchestrated by crooks widely lauded for their fairness caring and honesty it would be the height of arrogance to tell the defrauded that he deserved it and should shut up about it and let it happen the depopulation and population replacement agenda first the eu has to accept at least a million asylumseekers annually for the foreseeable future the eu should provide  euros  per asylumseeker for each of the first two years to help cover housing healthcare and education costsand to make accepting refugees more appealing to member states 
dont be fooled this isnt happening because some vague invisible force called progress is pushing things inevitably in this direction no its being actively promoted by globalist interests that have adopted cultural marxism as a means of control 
why are native fertility rates declining below replacement level the major factors are women are encouraged to spend their s partying and their s trying to get rich in a cube farm encouraging them to to make starting a family last priority often leaves them very unhappy over the long term and many will miss the chance to begin good economy tends to be positively correlated with higher fertility rates during recessions births go down the implications are obvious if less tax money was taken from working citizens for costly social services programs and spitinyoureye wars then theyd be able to afford more children sending the guilty to prison instead of bailing them out when they crash the economy might be a good indirect measure too about a third of american babies conceived end up aborted  thanks feminism the same leftists who think this is wonderful will scream bloody murder whenever a savage killer on death row is executed but all thats another matter 
because of declining fertility rates the globalists tell us that we must open the floodgates of third world immigration to prop up the population and support the aging citizens so theyve fed us poison and to soothe the symptoms they want to feed us another kind of poison to hell with that 
granted keeping social security going in the usa will be a challenge still its pretty uncertain that newlyarriving immigrantsif they become the majoritywill be able or willing to support millions of elderly gringos as for future european retirees will they be well cared for by refugees from africa and the middle east the way things are now many of them prefer rioting  looting and collecting welfare over working so these are going to be the people propping up the european retirement programs 
dispossession is inevitable only if we let it happen for now we must educate the rest of the public about whats going on and convince them that their future is worth saving and their posterity is worth preserving once weve achieved critical mass we can confront the political establishment and get the government to start working for us rather than against us whats in it for us whenever someone writes that western civilization is nothing but injustice and oppression theyre using technology we invented to complain about us 
its fashionableespecially in academiato bash western civilization were not perfect but nobody else is either the truth is that were a creative dynamic and industrious people some of us are under the impression that we dont have any culture only other people do but thats mistaken i could spend all day listing our major artists composers poets philosophers writers theologians and the like but i only would scratch the surface 
other cultures have made notable contributionsparticularly east asia and the middle eastbut the fact is that the majority of science and technology that makes life comfortable today originated in the western world electricity motorized transportation refrigeration telecommunications computers need i go on yep that was us we shared our medical advances with the rest of the world increasing longevity and quality of life around the globe whether the worlds future looks more like star trek or more like blade runner may have a lot to do with whether or not our people survive 
finally most of us are going to live out our lives in our native countries do we want them to stay the same nations we grew up in some time in the future todays youth will be running the show while were elderly what kind of a place do we want it to be by then western civilization is great lets keep it going",Fake
"as the election is inching slowly towards its end experts are nervously scrambling to find any dirt that would stop the trump train
first megyn kelly pulled the sexist card then it was his undisclosed tax returns then his comments on john mccain then making fun of crippled reporters then his reading of mein kampf then his remarks about dating his daughter
then accusations of racism from former employees his usage of eminent domain hiring of immigrants and other questionable practices the trump university scandal his blunder on abortion old comments on drug decriminalization and gun control his relationship with the clintons and the dc insiders his comments on refugees and illegal immigrants the khan incident and of course the pussygrabbing scandal

surely this time it will sink his campaign wont it  and yet each time teflon don deflects dirt more dexterously than ghetto trash trying escape alimony payments nothing seems to be able to stop him not that his opponents will ever stop trying
trump has the fantastic ability to escape unharmed from what would clearly destroy any career politician howard deans yeehaw was enough to end his bid for the democratic candidate in  and yet trump can call for an end to muslim refugees be accused of grabbing women by their loins and end up being praised for it by the masses while the mainstream media spew their bile 

what has allowed trump to maneuver so nimbly against these accusations is the unprecedented role of internet media in elections including being able to reach people directly through twitter and a lack of trust in traditional media as well as his biggerthanlife persona letting him get away with what others would be lynched for
but thats the story for another article i would rather talk about something else particularly is there anything that could stop him the answer will surprise you as it goes against all conventional wisdom
yes but its not what you think
trumps weak spot 
one of the biggest problems with defeating trump is that unlike other politicians political scandals not only seem to not affect him but they even aid him there is a saying that every antitrump meme is also a protrump meme

trump has mastered political antifragility which causes him to only strengthen when opponents try to destroy him trump has defeated the lefts no platform for fascists mentality by saying things so outrageous they have no option but to report on him
so the left cannot choose to not cover him and let him wallow in obscurity like they did with ron paul neither can they attack him for each of their attacks only make him more popular

one memorable movie quote i remember went something like this every man has a weak spot first you try to buy him with money then women then you go for his family and if that doesnt work well a bullet always does the job unfortunately unlike other political losers don does not need other peoples money nor does he lack female attention and his family is smart and probably safe from violence
but this isnt an article about god forbid donald trump getting assassinated that would stop trump but not the trump train trump is more than a man trump is an idea he is the avatar of discontent of all those opposed to progressive ideology he would become a martyr thus raising the hatred for his opponents to a fever pitch which might alter americas consciousness forever trumps enemies cant afford that
so if ignoring trump does not work throwing dirt at him does not work bribing him doesnt work and even killing him wont work than what is left the answer might surprise you
you see trumps power comes from his contrarianism he is not a candidate he is an anticandidate people dont just vote for trump they vote against hillary obama progressives and cuckservatives he is the wrecking ball who the injured working class and all nonliberal whites as well as minorities not completely in love in with progressive marxist ideology want to use against the establishment
so what can be done to stop him  
well lets ask ourselves what makes trump popular  his brashness his antipc attitudes his antielitism his not being a part of the establishment hacks his being not one of them his being different
so if that is what gives trump strength it would make sense that to weaken him you would have to present him as the opposite of that to present him as being nothing special to make him look boring and weak to present him as just another pcdrone
theyve claimed nonstop that trump is the next hitler and that he will start building concentration camps and sexually assaulting random women by grabbing their cock pockets and will obliterate muslims and minorities with right wing death squad robots

instead they could have claimed that he is just weakling trying to act tough and that he wont deliver anything that he is in love with political correctness and respects women that he is a progressives best choice that he will bring four more years of obama
that of course would present its own difficulties in the age of online media the monopoly of physical press has been broken when news circulates at the speed of minutes rather than hours and days it would be very hard for the establishment media to accomplish this it is very hard to call trump ordinary and boring when his statements break so many taboos
yet as difficult as it may have been at the very least it would have had a chance of success as small as it was calling him sexist racist and other mean words did nothing to stop him and instead only made him more popular with the masses some of these incidents have made donald seem human and it made people trust him more showing his flaws had the opposite effect as intended as those who hated him already needed no extra ammo but those who liked him were either left indifferent or whats worse excited by his statements

at worst a few moderates had doubts set in their mind however considering what short attention span undecided voters have his stellar performance at the second debate clearly made them forget about the statement and maybe even convinced them to focus on bills sexual misdeeds instead
why havent his opponents used this against him 
this brings us to the final point of this article why havent his opponents used this against him have they not the brains to figure this out hard to believe considering the amount of money being poured into think tanks
no the truth is like that the strategy was forsaken because of the sideeffects it would have on their own camp should his opponents try to attack him as another pc drone they would be also attacking themselves just like hillary trying to paint trump as sex offender only made it easier for trump to point at bills sexual indiscretions as it has been said in the mighty book of kek  thee that dwell in glass lodgings shall not propel sedimentary formations the prophecy of kek chapter   verse  

attacking trump for being multicultural politically correct weak inefficient or a shill would only shed light on the establishments own weakness
this means that in order to draw voters away from trump they would have to claim trump loves multiculturalism antiracism open borders free trade globalism and offer another candidate who would be even more extreme than him on these crucial issues

using this strategy against trump even if it was successful would be a pyrrhic victory for his opponents as cuckservatives would have to acknowledge they cant woo supporters with talks about reducing taxes and bringing back reaganism the truth is the future is bleak for reaganbushcuck wing of the gop even if they were to win the election they would lose the war

the left has won the cultural war not just by winning elections but by cultural metawarfare instead of moderating their message in attempt to win election they used popular culture and mass media to push liberal values to the masses and so the right wing had no option but do concessions dropping people who opposed civil rights womens liberation and closed borders
to put it simply the battle was lost even before trump cametrump was the match that ignited the powder keg he simply mobilized people and said what others kept in private but always wanted to say and now there is no turning back
the elites cannot choose to ignore popular will and still win elections anymore they will have to reform the gop to account for their constituencys desire or risk ending in the dust bin of history there is no longer the option to charm the sheeple with talks about low taxes open borders and the awfulness of bigotry they will have to at least nominally give something back to the people to stay in power
as one wise commenter on this site once said  trump may be a liar like the rest of them but at least he is saying the right lies
the next thing people on the manosphere and the altright will have to look after will be trumplike figures who will copy trumps rhetoric but will fail to deliver any solutions or they will try to coopt and redirect that anger but for now for the first time in more than  years we are winning the culture war

"cuckservatism is a topic that has previously been discussed in detail on return of kings  in articles and comments sections alike the underlying reason that this topic is the focus of a great deal of discussion is because its roots are deeply steeped in both cowardice and betrayal
while our readership is well acquainted with the political and social implications of cuckservatism there is also a need to also discuss its behavioral roots to accomplish this task i used my social media accounts to examine connections of mine who displayed all of the classic red flags associated with cuckservatism i then searched for common traits that they possessed based on the nature of their rants or posts
the three characteristics listed below represent key factors which in my opinion are necessary for any individual to transform from an otherwise normal person into a cuck if we can understand these factors this will enable us to develop a more comprehensive strategy for rendering them irrelevant apart from merely ignoring them
political naivetÃ© nothing screams political naivety more than voting for a last minute candidate who considers himself a conservative alternative to trump
this factor represents the first step that one must take to become a cuckservative because it entails believing in a series of premises that are patently false political naivetÃ© can include simpler forms such as believing in the wage gap or that illegal immigrants are natural republicans conversely political naivetÃ© can also be more complex in that an individual afflicted with it might believe in equality as a virtue or that a democratic two party system is the best form of government 
a perfect example of this can be seen in my friends and associates who blindly believe in the constitution these individuals refuse to vote for anyone other than a constitutionalist and their sole metric for judging candidates is the implications of an obscure constitutional issue that only they care about this perspective is indicative of political naiveÃ© because the globalists who run our political system jettisoned any belief in the constitution and rule of law decades ago for them the constitution is merely a convenient rubber stamp used to justify unpopular political decisions 
accordingly anyone who votes only for candidates with such narrow viewpoints is naively playing into the hands of globalists because they fail to understand that the constitution will only function in a nation thats virtuous and willing to abide by its principles 
if the united states continues on its current demographic track we will eventually import a new population that not only despises original american values but would also actively vote to eliminate them the constitution will provide no protections if this occurs because these people will simply ignore it invoking arguably the most important phrase in all of american legal history  
to fail to understand these stakes when considering ones voting patterns instead opting to emulate the local revolutionary war reenactors is a hallmark trait of a cuckservative 
lack of self confidence a cuckservative would never get this far
lack of selfconfidence and the feelings of doubt that serve as its foundation represents a second symptom of cuckservatism which is why return of kings has countless articles on how to acquire and maintain selfconfidence as a form of preventative medicine 
doubts as to ones chances of success coupled with fear and the innate need for selfpreservation can easily shatter most people in such moments of weakness its very easy for a person to do a  and to do something that they would normally find revolting conversely if one steadfastly believes in their convictions and themselves their selfconfidence will become stronger this is true even in situations when seemingly the entire world is against them 
the following clip is from an interview that jeb bush did with lester holt during the republican primary and is an excellent illustration of how a lack of selfconfidence can lead to powerlessness and a lack of control over ones surroundings 

from the very beginning of this clip jebs lack of self confidence is readily apparent whether it was the fact that he was too far hunched over in his seat his attempts to curb his nervousness by forcing himself to smile or laugh or the fact that he rarely made eye contact with lester holt any ability that he has to project himself was undermined by his body language
an even deeper sign of his lack of selfconfidence begins at  in the video when holt proceeds to ask him why he didnt frame the charleston shooting as an act of racism in this situation if asked such a question in any setting an individual has one of two choices if he is selfconfident he would turn the question back on lester holt by saying that racism is a social construct and the only people who care about it are limpwristed losers
however if one is like jeb and lacks selfconfidence their response to this situation will be to immediately try to compromise by acknowledging the premise raised by someone like lester holt and then spend the rest of the interview trying to show that theyre not a bad person this was the approach that jeb used and it demonstrated to lester holt that he was weak which then led to lester forcing jeb to backtrack and question his own decision to support stand your ground laws during his tenure as floridas governor
a lack of selfconfidence as evidenced by jebs failure to retain control over his surroundings during his interview with lester holt highlights a classic character trait shared by cuckservatives the only answer that i can come up with as to why this trait is so prevalent is that it might be a product of their childhood that they havent been able to get over
in a way the archetypal cuck was likely bullied or mistreated as a child but has never learned how to fight back or to love being hated by others because of this they never developed the necessary level of selfconfidence to succeed in life which eventually translates over to their politics
they want to be friends with everyone how to destroy a political movement established by ones father in one fell swoop
having grown up in the leftist northeast and considering that i still live and work there im used to being in the political minority my coping mechanisms for this situation consisted of unknowingly embracing key tenets of the alternative right and knowing how to pick my political fights additionally i also resolved to never be friendly with or ever trust anyone from the political left a decision that has been vindicated over the last several years 
unfortunately my approach is not a popular one amongst political dissidents in my region this is because many of them having grown up with leftists simply view their political disagreements as a series of gentlemanly differences that they can put aside over a few beers they refuse to believe that leftists and sjws hate anyone who even slightly disagrees with them and like women view weak men as easy targets 
accordingly when faced with the choice of staying true to their beliefs or moderating them in order to ensure that they get invited to the next sushi night art showing or paint nite the cuckservatives that i know will roll over every time specifically theyll profess support for third party libertarian or constitutional candidates while supporting a slightly lessliberal version of their leftist friends politics 
this tendency demonstrates a key principle that most cuckservatives subconsciously hold they want to be liked by everyone and will therefore do anything they can to make this happen even if it means betraying themselves and their own beliefs in the process when does adopting this attitude ever lead to success in life 
if a child keeps getting beat up by a schoolyard bully should they cower in the bullys presence and act as his lackey in order to avoid getting hurt we all know that such an approach is worthless and that the only way to respond is to fight back yet these people adopt the same approach when dealing with the political equivalent of a schoolyard bully perhaps their reason for trying to be friends with globalists and trying to appease them by being moderate stems from the way in which they handled problems in childhood however that issue itself is another topic that deserves discussion by itself 
is there a remedy for these character flaws even if we understand these characteristics and can think of active ways to subvert cuckservatism we will not be entirely successful most people who fall under this category have been psychologically conditioned to act this way meaning that much of our attempts to open their eyes will fall on deaf ears i have no sympathy for these people because theyve never had the internal drive or fortitude necessary to overcome adversity and would rather wallow in misery while also pulling others into the abyss with them 
however there are always a couple that might show potential these individuals might only be seen by us as cuckservatives because they imitated others around them while lacking a positive role model that could show them the truth the greatest service we can do for these select few is to identify them and prove that there is a viable alternative 
if  cents a day can supposedly help a starving african family have rice for six months then us acting as positive role models to our weaker brethren will help them immeasurably while also advancing our own cause

"american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand american woman in bikini desecrates french catacombs for her female indiana jones brand 
andrÃ© is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   girls 
the paris catacombs are a place dear to my heart born in this very city i had a front row seat to see it turn into a giant museum every wealthy asshole wanting his own piece of the city of lights and paris being one of the most visited cities in the world  i could see year after year the streets taken over by luxury clothing shops and expensive venues the middle and lower classes have been pushed aside by rising living costs so that the rich globalists the bobos and a neverending trail of tourists could stroll around 
yet go twenty meters below the haussmanian hurdle and you will find something very different 
south of the seine the lands have been deeply dug to extract building stones most of the voids have been filled since but more than a hundred kilometres of mine galleries are still there exploring the place is officially forbidden which is a good thing as one can go there officiously provided one knows how to enter and not get lost in the labyrinth without bothering with swarms of tourists or wasting money in an overpriced bar 
officially prohibited actually more or less selfmanaged by a loose community of cataphiles  the catacombs are one of the most interesting places today in paris it allows for genuine explorations and friendly meetings while also teaching some masculine virtues to those who venture there seriously 
the underground network being fragile and the officials not enjoying when too many visitors tread on their jurisdiction the cataphiles have a complex relationship with exposing it on the one hand we like to show the place and share its atmosphere with passionate newcomers on the other we are afraid that too much exposition will attract too many visitors and stifle the officials relative toleration for unofficial activities 
well today other cataphiles wont chastise me for mentioning the topic in public for this has been already made recently by an attention whore of international scope alison teal a hawaiian  or  years old girl made a show of herself down there and sent ludicrous photos to the daily mail  so im here to teach you about protecting the planet yknow i love bringing surfboards in places without waves by the way im the feminine indiana jones especially with the help of a crew ill never give credit to follow me on instagram and yt 
here we are not talking about attention whoring lightly the daily mail photos already tell much a blond girl in a pink bikini carries a pink surfboard in a narrow underground network where there is by definition no waves to surf at all to take some photos of herself herself herself and a bit of the catacombs as they could be used as the setting of the latest of alisons adventures im not joking these adventures are literally hitler a trademark 
since she was at least  teal seems to have taken advantage from the nomadic lifestyle of her parents to make photos movies and promote herself heavily along the way with the help of her dad a wellconnected photographer and selfpromoter who claims to master yoga she got a bunch of awards and media promotion longhaired alison was thus handed a niche that allows her to travel the world take pictures of herself in various places and claim to be concerned about the environment 
her rÃ©sumÃ© shows a massive ego associated to minor lies the world was my school and playgroundi guess smaller places would be too small for her giant ego and this may explain why she suffered from claustrophobia under paris as we are to see below between namedroppings references to media awards and other big pictures of alison teal and alison teal we learn she was styled the female indiana jones by time magazine  and the oprah of adventure by the huffington post  really 
actually teal said to the huffpo she aspired to be the oprah of adventure in  before branding herself as the female indiana jones to the time a year later  not  then she said on twitter and on her rÃ©sumÃ© how they had referred to her as such not a big lie but a lie indeed by the way she also branded herself a tarzan child in the huffpo interview would someone who really grew up in the wild be so obsessed with linking herself to famous icons excerpt from the huffpo article  the same articles adds she is a selfdescribed tarzan child excerpt from the time article  named by time magazine or selfstyled and now on her rÃ©sumÃ© not only does she lie by misattributing to famous media outlets selfcharacterizing and lavishly flattering labels but she cant even put the right years while referring to said media pieces 
so selfstyled female indiana jones no less went through what seems to be a joint undertaking with the daily mail by descending into the paris catacombs with the symbols of her adventures namely a pink bikini and a surfboard the english tabloid released the photos video and testimony of indianajonesinabikinisurfingthecatacombs the  th of october days after a bunch of french outlets copied the mail content often translating it verbatim  
what struck me first are the stunning inaccuracies the tabloid published first the mail claims teal went  meters below the ground whereas the actual depth of the catacombs goes between  and  meters depending on where you are in the network cant indiana jane tell the difference between  and  meters 
second she also claimed to have lacked oxygen and witnessed the water level suddenly rising this is at best extremely unlikely the water levels can change from month to month and even from week to week but to my knowledge it never changes abruptly in seconds as for the oxygen issue i have witnessed some only two times at a big party when so many people were in the same room that there was not enough oxygen to light a cigarette and from claustrophobic newcomers who could not stand the place 
either she completely made up the sudden water change and oxygen issues in order to give her story a sensational aspect or more likely got a panic attack due to claustrophobia but preferred to twist it into a grandiose plot rather than acknowledging her own limitations the mail just ate that up and published without question they did not ask any actual cataphile for sure had they done so anyone with a decent experience of the catacombes could have told them what i just wrote above 
i also noticed from her quotes that she does not mention anyone from her crew gives no credit to the men who opened the manhole cover helped her go down the humid ladder showed her the way filmed her she would never have found the entrance if no one already in the know had accepted to be her guide neither could she lift manhole covers of more than a hundred kilograms with her thin armseven the round butt she likes to display couldnt do that the first photo displayed by the mail notice how she strategically displays some of her butt 
i could bet she did not have sex with any of the guys who enabled her display to happen as julius evola hinted she is likely the kind of woman to whom the possibilities of physical love are often not as interesting as the narcissistic cult of her body or as being seen with as many or as few clothes as possible evola revolt against the modern world  chap 
in this respect the only thing that makes teal special compared to all other lookatme twats is the adventurous label she tries to put on herself exploiting people and places to garner attention is definitely not special yet a lot of comments have noticed this behind the weird mix of glamour and pseudoadventure some are offended that she treaded on bones ie remnants of real past men in a pink bikini doing so is not only a proof of bad taste and selfaggrandizing maniait is also utterly disrespectful 
this is indeed a blatant example of pussy pass  imagine going to hawaii bringing a skateboard at a local cemetery and start skateboarding over the graves in a pink throng what do you expect would happen you would probably get beaten by locals and if the media gave you attention at all they would label you as a disturbed troll or something like that all this i think would be fair but when a selfimportant oprah jane of superadventure does the same the mainstream media reacts completely differently and celebrates her without the least hint of criticism 
though she treading and surfing on bones of actual past people is not very respectful for sure i think especially appalling the outlook teal seems to carry on the place the catacombs are just another background for alison adventures whole places some loaded with historical and spiritual significance are reduced to a set for the egotic show of another vapid character the entire world was her school or so she said meaning that the world is turned into a mixture of disneyland and hollywood studio where her picture can stroll around some weeks ago alison teal was busy showing herself near an erupting volcano notice another strategic partdisplay of her butt 
usual newcomers to the catacombs come there with a genuine interest in the place they come to find out sometimes drink and have an actual adventure they cannot help but feel some humility perhaps even awe when meeting with the bones of millions of nameless dead most if not all of them having lived before the nineteenth century and having been carried there so that paris could grow 
this is very different from using the place to play adventure treading on bones in a rather inappropriate outfit depending on a crew of real cataphiles but forgetting to give them the slightest credit and showing utter carelessness to the historical and spiritual significance of the place all so that alisons ego adventures show continues 
as you can see above a lot of the comments are negativeespecially those from cataphiles and teal has discreetly withdrawn the video of her trail from youtube putting it into private mode 
teals circus has at least one merit it symbolizes pretty well one of the worst aspects of the westernization of the world in the west there is no wilderness no sacredness no magic there are tons of potential places for tourism but ultimately all these places are losing their soul and turning into disneylands the catacombs are worth it because they are definitely not so and should never be 
fortunately there can be some immanent justice the wave of criticism under teals disrespectful show is well deserved more harshly a young libtard who thought she could hitchhike through middle east to prove muslims peaceful got raped and killed by the peaceful ones she theatrically claimed to care about the event shew or should have shown that the world is not a giant kindergarten for western strong and independent narcissists 
in a world of selfmarketing and selfcentred cunts everyone is too busy caring about ones image and about meaningless representations to truly care about a place or about family members 
truly respectable women are not the ones we spot the most easily and true cataphiles are often discreet as well your humble servant bathed there before teal pretended to surf the place but i would definitely not exhibit myself treading on bones in a pink thong",Fake

it was not immediately clear what was occurring in the crowd but several members of what appeared to be law enforcement or us secret service jumped down into the area where the protester was as could be seen on right side broadcasting networks video livestream of the event 
video of trump being rushed off stage was posted online 
in the video it appears trump pauses to look out into the crowd for the event disrupter two us secret service agents can be seen rushing in to remove trump from the stage and two other agents also facilitate his removal 
during his absence someone announced to the crowd that trump would return the protester was eventually seen being removed from the crowd although there appeared to be a struggle with several law enforcement or secret service agents to secure the protesters removal it was several minutes before trump was able to take the stage again 
as trump returned to the stage he thanked the crowd which cheered him back 
nobody said it was going to be easy for us but we will never be stopped never ever be stopped said trump here is the man in question in handcuffs being searched by officers after he was escorted out of the rally area pictwittercompjomctmk",Fake
"a tenperson federal jury has found that rolling stone journalist sabrina rubin erdely defamed university of virginia dean nicole eramo with actual malice over a fraudulent college rape story rolling stone and its parent company wenner media were also found to have defamed eramo who is seeking  million in damages but to a lesser extent than the writer herself rubin erdelys piece conveyed that eramo was indifferent and even callous towards the accuser jackie coakley  in addition to discouraging her from reporting the crime and so continues coverage of the rape hoax of the decade
the controversy which began with the publication of rubin erdelys story in  centered on a now debunked fraternity gang rape alleged by fabulist coakley  well before this weeks court decision rubin erdely admitted to not bothering to contact the male uva students accused of the act these young men via their phi kappa psi fraternity are suing separately for  million  a surprisingly low figure which makes eramos claim look comparatively astronomical
sabrina rubin erdely far left arrives for court pictured on the right is the deputy managing editor of rolling stone sean woods instrumental in the bogus storys publication and who defended it later
because of coakleys limited financial position and the respect even outed sexual assault frauds are given eramo is legally pursuing only rubin erdely rolling stone  and wenner media for the  million nevertheless eramos attempts to portray herself as a victim are troubling she was after all uvas goto college administrator for handling sexual violence cases a euphemism for the organizer of what are basically kangaroo courts
aside from eramo uva president teresa sullivans actions were appalling giving basic credence to jackies allegations sullivan suspended all greek life activities at the university of virginia as publicity about the accusations grew this only increased the suffering of the falsely maligned fraternity members plus gave ammunition to the rape culture activists who ridiculously represent every young male on campus as a potential sexual abuser of women
the true victims are the falsely accused young men not nicole eramo nicole eramo is a victim of the same system she helps to prop up and defend rape culture
nicole eramo may have been defamed but she was also intricately involved in a uva system that does not afford young men even the most basic procedural rights whilst we should be happy that she did not rush into supporting jackie coakleys lies to the extent of trying to eschew police involvement we are still not dealing with either an admirable or upstanding individual
after extensive research i am yet to find instances of eramo challenging the shameful treatment of college students accused of sexual assault whether in specific instances or more broadly she is neither a defender of these young men nor some kind of principled whistleblower the only positive thing that can be generally said of her is that she is somewhat less prone to typical kneejerk sjw reactions ie she did try to get jackie to talk to the police
again jackie coakley has escaped any punishment stupid does not even begin to describe the man who decided to marry rape hoaxer jackie coakley thanks to chuck johnson and wwwgotnewscom for their work in outing coakley as a fabulist and sociopath
jackie coakley is the sociopathic architect of this whole mess notwithstanding that rubin erdely and others would have gleefully found another poster girl from somewhere else in america the degree of malice and calculation in coakleys actions is the worst i have seen even the very terrible crystal mangum  the black stripper who is now serving a long sentence for homicide not false rape allegations made her bogus accusations of racism and being gang raped much more opportunistically after duke lacrosse players declined her services as a stripper coakleys misdeeds however inhabit a world of their own
because women like jackie coakley obsessed as they are with fantasy worlds and selfvictimization have next to no money to go after in defamation suits they need to be charged and prosecuted for crimes such as public mischief it obviously would be better if they were charged with making a false rape claim yet coakley had enough selfpreserving foresight to avoid talking to the police consequently the system usually gives next to no remedies for discouraging outright lies about rape to boot the washington post may have savaged rubin erdely and rolling stone  but it still refuses to publish jackie coakleys full name despite all the evidence completely disproving the rape accusations
if nicole eramo gets  million the accused male uva students deserve  billion attentionseeker emily renda she used jackie coakleys lies to promote an agenda not seek redress for a victim
determination of damages in the nicole eramo case is yet to take place and the  million claim may just have been posturing by her legal team a high watermark figure designed to secure a smaller but nonetheless very tidy sum at a minimum the accused uva students deserve  times more than whatever eramo gets of course wenner medias coffers are nowhere near that big but the principle remains compared to the mauled reputations of the witchhunted fraternity members eramo suffered a slight pinprick from a broken system she has otherwise staked her career on supporting and expanding
other villains in this saga also need to be held to account chief among them is emily renda  a sociology major at uva who is now completing a law degree at uc berkeley a rape culture extremist she acted as the conduit between coakley and rubin erdely as chuck johnson and got news have already demonstrated rendas own rape survivor story has changed  biased journalists such as anna merlan  formerly of jezebel  additionally promoted the uva hoax and were greatly upset when the gang rape was found not to have taken place so many supporting actors created this mess
lets hope that the heavy legal blows against rubin erdely rolling stone  and obliquely jackie coakleys lies continue with the uva fraternity defamation suit only significant financial and legal hardship not the pangs of conscience will stop sjws and their enablers from attempting to ruin the lives of innocent men

"many older physical trainers and even those younger ones who were proteges of the older men will tell the trainee that there is an inverse correlation between strength and speedthat being too big and muscular will slow down an athlete for whatever reason i have found that this is most prevalent amongst traditional martial artists the usual reason given is that the increased mass is simply a dead weight while those with a little bit more knowledge will explain that lifting will develop slow twitch muscles over the fast twitch muscles needed for sprinting jumping punching and kicking
i am here to tell you that the common wisdom is completely wrongwhen done properly weightlifting will not impede your speed and will in fact enhance your speed and explosiveness
anecdotes perhaps youve heard of this man

that is of course jamaicas usain bolt the fastest man in the world and holder of multiple olympic records also worth noting is that in an interview mr bolt revealed that he squats  pounds and at least partially attributes his nigh inhuman speed to his training regimen and hes not the only speed athlete who this can be said oflook at any olympic class sprinter they are all quite muscular fellows

similarly other athletic disciplines thats athletics in the specific rather than general sense im using the european term for what my countrymen call track and field have claimed to utilize weightlifting in their training such as the long jump and the hurdles or you can take my word for it at my best i had a one rep max squat of  pounds and had a  inch vertical leap i am judging this by my ability to perform a standing jump over ndhighest position hurdles which are measured at  inches 
in fact many worldlevel athletes of all disciplines are utilizing olympic style weightlifting to develop speed and powe r
anyway you slice it compound weight training is a fantastic supplement to all athletes even those who seemingly dont need that raw brute strength
the science as i elaborated in this article  as well as in the free pdf i offer to subscribers to my website the subscription signup is on the front page theres more than one type of way to be athletic more accurately there are three speaking purely in terms of muscular andor nervous system function so this does not include handtoeye coordination or other skills related to team sports these three things can loosely correlate to the three types of muscle fibersredor slowoxidative fast glycolyticor white and fast oxidative rather than rehash an article that ive already written we will focus on the white muscle the fast glycolytic this is the type of muscle you want to be training for if you want to develop sprinting speed or a high vertical leap
or to put this into terms of newtons second law of motion accelerationforcemass ie the amount of muscular force you can exert divided by your body weighthow fast you can accelerate and yes i am aware that theres probably a more mathematically accurate way of putting this
which exercises to do it is at this point that youre probably asking which exercises you should train to develop those physical skills you desire if you read my articles regularly you will know what i am likely to saycompound free weight lifting
in fact ill go out on a limb and say if you dont know which exercise you should do to develop a certain physical trait you should always default to a compound lift unless you receive some further information that says otherwise training for speed or vertical leap is no exception to this rule
if you are looking for sheer running speed and leaping ability the power lifts that hit the lower body are most effective deep ass to grass squats deadlifts and the clean and jerk are used by professional athletes to great effect

similarly if you want the ability to throw a ball or punch harder upper body compound lifts are the key bench presses overhead presses and yes the clean and jerk will see you through

so for those of you who are afraid that your athletic performance will be somehow impeded by heavy weightlifting nothing could be further from the truth

what i dont get is why are gals bitching this is the world they wanted they clawed and scratched and burned their bras and had court cases and threw fits to get exactly what they have they hated men because they said men werent letting them copulate frantically like men had always wanted them to men or more likely their mothers didnt let them make themselves unattractive by dressing like hodcarriers and swearing like sailors finally men gave in and now women hate them for that  whatever happened to gratitude

sooner rather than later all internet roads will lead to the same new world order socialist philosophy
as profiling of internet users becomes more prolific and the algorithms more sophisticated in the coming years the news and information we search for will be tailored to slowly nudge us one way or the other politically one small step at a time
the management of the information we get to read is already in its infancy
why do you think that free app on your phone that only performs a few functions swells in size with each update that is released do you really think they give a damn about your privacy and are plugging security holes hell no the apps we download are moving from useful lowresource using services to resource hogs necessitating an upgrade in processing power every year or two because they only provide us with a free service in order to hook us so the apps can gather information about everything weve ever written on our devices for social engineers and marketing flacks the apps are becoming more sophisticated in the way they monitor everything we do  which is why the apps need all that memory size
and soon apps will be gathering information about everything weve ever said aloud by using the built in microphones on each device and speech recognition technology cia agents confirm microphones can easily be activated even when a device is switched completely off
this type of information will be collected in giant databases such as the utah data center with the ultimate goal being the corporategovernment complex knowing more about us than we know about ourselves
big brother was so yesterday orwells big brother idea never could have imagined the insidious nature of todays information technology
todays information technology has put big brother on steroids
the waking times details this frightful world that is already emerging as anyone who pays attention knows search engines are already tailoring information to what we search for and even what we text people about
mr x weve studied the little virtual bubble you live in and now we can sell you your own special brand of truth
most of the time the information one will see in this internet bubble will be customized to suit a persons interests this is why facebook relentlessly pushes the like a page or product portion of its web site this information is used to build a profile of a person that ultimately will be able to accurately predict the color of their next bowel movement
if a man is interested in nongmo foods advertising and news stories will be tailored to inform him of grocers who sell organics and about news from approved outlets with stories written on the topic most of the time this will be insidious advertising and ads disguised as information
hello audience were going to pitch you on becoming fullfledged obsessed consumers as if there is no other worthy goal in lifeand then were going to profile you from top to bottom to find out exactly what kind of obsessed consumer you are so we can hit you and trigger you with information that uniquely stimulates your adrenal glands
the utah data center is designed to store exabytes of information on all forms of communication including emails cell phone calls and internet searches as well as all types of personal data trailsparking receipts travel itineraries and bookstore purchases
as another example okay we know you are interested in traditional gender roles we  the information managers like facebook and google will now to find news stories and customize the information you get to read online in order to cause you to doubt the validity of your beliefs the ultimate goal is to slowly but steadily move you away from believing in traditional gender roles to believing in militant feminism without you realizing what we have done
this type of information management is even more insidious than outright censorship as it will be designed to steer everyone towards what the controllers of society want us to think and buy no matter how far from the ideal consumer and fellow traveler we may be
think of it as a game of plinko on the price is right in which all chips ultimately fall into the perfect braindead consumer slot at the bottom of the maze the social engineers dream is a world of nothing but sexless consumers who perform mindless work in meaningless jobs whose only outlets for pleasure are shopping and eating out and other stateapproved activities
think thats hyperbole travel around the world for six months to a year then come back to the united states and tell me what you think
little information bubbles merge into big information bubbles we become what we are repeatedly exposed to which is why a war is on for your mind
once we have you believing a certain way or questioning your established beliefs the key comes when it is time to steer public perception one way or the other this is where the rubber meets the road in the realm of managing the populace like so many sheeple
but when a big one comes along like the  national election in the us the separate tunes come together and ring as one then the overriding need to extend globalisms goals in the person of hillary clinton blot out every other priority then the major media twist whatever they need to twist then its the same bubble for everyone
soon just like the mainstream media on television and in print everything you see online will be directed at making you think behave and vote a certain way the micromanagement and control of information just hasnt become that sophisticated  yet
obama already hinted that only official information should be linked up by the corporate interests of facebook google etc look for hillary to implement that idea with an iron fist if she is whisked into the oval office  an internet security crisis will likely be engineered in the near future in whichyou guessed itbig daddy government needs to step in and take control of the web from there on out we will be back to corporategovernment propaganda instead of the libertarians dream the current iteration of the internet is
so the awakening we have seen from the brainwashing of the corporate media will be a temporary one if the elite have anything to do with it the groundwork of this new socialist system of micromanaging information is already being laid you already see it every time you do a search
someday soon the only information well be able to find online will be from sources the corporategovernment complex approves of of course there will be renegades and rebels like us who resist but most of the braindead sheeple out there will go along to get along just as has been happening since time immemorial
our options will be to get off the grid or to move to a new internet neither move will be peacefully tolerated by the powers that be

"is there any merit in taking a cynical view of life are the observations of cynicism realistic brave observations on human nature freed from sentimentality or are they only the somber commentary offered by one who is a loser at the game of life taking solace in his weakness and failure there are compelling arguments either way what is not disputed however is that franÃ§ois de la rouchefoucauld was one of the most brilliantly cynical epigrammers who ever lived
it probably did not help that he came from a long line of noblemen for nothing so enfeebles the soul as much as inherited wealth and titles he was born in  and inherited the title of duke on the death of his father in  receiving the usual education of his class he dabbled in military matters in his teens various itinerant love affairs followed with wellplaced women but some of these ended badly we find him imprisoned in bastille for a week in  for political intrigue

although married he continued to pursue other women as was the custom of the time and his station marriages in those days were business affairs to be ignored at each partys pleasure or necessity one such dalliance resulted in an illegitimate child but the woman eventually rejected him for a more appealing competitor in  he found himself mixed up with a quasirevolt called the fronde an adventure that left him with impaired sight when he was struck with a musket ball in the head health problems also intervened to add to his misery in the form of gout and melancholy
in late seventeenth century france the paris salons were centers of debate discussion and the flowering of controversial ideas by now la rochefoucauld had acquired an acrid talent for stinging prose and he knew how to use it his failures in love and war had primed his spirit for a cynical view of life and this predilection meshed well with the taste of the salons for savage wit nothing is so shallow as sophistication
from his frequent visits to the salon of mme de sable in paris he had begun to piece together a body of epigrams that represented his worldview one of his peers had more commercial goals in mind for a bootleg collection of  of his sayings was first published without his permission and with no attribution in  two years later he finally put out a proper edition this contained  maxims the volume was titled sentences et maximes morales  but this is usually shortened to maxims 
there is a philosophy here it centers around the idea that all men are selfseeking egoists to a fault any virtue a man displays is only a smokescreen concealing his selflove our virtues are only vices in disguise human vanity takes precedence over nearly all else virtues are lost in selfinterest as rivers are in the sea even the nobler emotions like love and altruism according to la rochefoucauld are only a kind of traffic in which selflove ever proposes to be the gainer he took a dim view of women finding them fit only for love for men such as himself of course and procreation one of his crueler maxims was few womens worth lasts longer than their beauty

but lifes realities eventually caught up with him softening his rougher edges his wife who had cared for him in his infirmities for eighteen years died in  his mothers death followed two years later two of his sons would eventually die of injuries received in frances ruinous wars of the period
this gloomy picture was brightened by the entry into his life of the mme de la fayette who was twenty years his junior she invited him to stay with her in paris and he was carried there with difficulty she seems to have viewed him as a reform project she would later say that he gave me understanding but i reformed his heart perhaps his fame made him an interesting captive the union worked and seemed to alleviate his dark picture of humanity and when his final hours came he asked for and received the last rites of the church in 
a fair assessment of la rochefoucauld must take into account his undeniable wit his probing sensitivity and his ability to strip away the pretenses behind many human actions yet all in all his maxims are meager in result many of them are superficial and shallow the product of a personality still nursing the wounds of an early disillusionment we weary of his aphorisms after two or three pages and hesitate to reopen his book later
worse still he was wrong to say that virtue and altruism are shams nothing is more vital to life and we can see them around us every day if only we know where to look and as long as our senses are not blinded by fear timor animi auribus officit  as sallust says fear blocks out the ears

any bitter weakling can be a cynic but it takes depth of character to accept the worldsand mansfaults and foibles and to balance those against mans unquestioned capacity for greatness of soul broader life experiences might have corrected la rochefoucaulds errors but he preferred to remain in a state of arrested development while receiving the applause and notoriety of paris society his maxims can bring smiles to our faces as it is easy to find amusement in the flaws of others yet we forget that his barbs were directed at us as well
montaigne was far wiser for he took a balanced view of life accepting the worlds absurdities and joys with the equanimity and calm resolution of a greek or roman sage he was also a better man la rochefoucauld was intelligent without being wise and never found the confidence in himself to submit his ego to the consolatory power of a higher philosophical authority in any form cynicism in the end strips a man of his most important protective armor and leaves him naked to face the cruelties of life no cynic ever died a happy man

happiness its what we all want as human beings no matter the differences in where we seek them we are motivated to do things to be happy and we avoid things that may detract from it even those who claim that they dont care about happiness or that theyre living for a higher purpose is doing what they do because it makes them happy in that way happiness is beyond a state of feeling it is a state of being 
now although you dont want to be obsessive about happiness and make your life revolve around attaining it there are few things you can do to live a more fulfilling life and improve the quality of your being and as its often the case with selfimprovement i believe that addressing the bad habits will lead to a healthier life than trying to gain the positives 
here are some ways you may be sabotaging your own happiness  you are chasing it ill be happy once i finally 
the more you chase happiness the less you have of it and not only are people today chasing happiness theyre chasing all the wrong things in hopes that it will bring them everlasting joy money women and status may elevate your life but they cant be the source of happiness alone they will especially fail as being compensation for some void in your life that youre trying to fill 
also know that your mood will naturally fluctuate over time constantly obsessing over how you feel and getting stressed over your emotional state will not help you so rather than jumping from one thing to another in hopes that it will boost your mood or dull your pain focus on things that matter to you its far better to work on selfimprovement and enhancing the overall quality of your life than be wavered by feelings  you dont have the basics taken care of good sleep is extremely underrated in our busy society it affects your mood testosterone level mental capacity and more prioritize sleep as much as you do with healthy diet and working out 
its often the basics that are overlooked ask yourself are you sleeping well its harder to tell than you think are you eating healthy are you keeping yourself fit are you getting enough sunlight do you ever take the time to connect with nature do you have a stable life do you have a purpose or a meaning i doubt most people have all of these basic needs checked off but im willing to bet that an improvement in even one area will significantly improve a persons mood and well being  you concern yourself with things you cant control no something bad is happening in the world and i cant do jack shit about it time to complain about it on the internet 
the more you sweat over issues which you can take no practical action over the more helpless you feel and the more unhappy you will be of course being able to tell the difference between what you can control and what you cant is an art in itself that you need to master through experience one thing im personally doing to lower stress is to reduce my news consumption and be less concerned with events around the world that are irrelevant to my personal life ill read enough to get a general awareness of whats happening around the world but i refuse to be emotionally invested in things i have no control over  you lack intimacy and deep human connection if you dont have any friends to be vulnerable with you didnt have any to begin with 
i would argue that this is one of the biggest if not the biggest factor in causing anxiety depression and general unhappiness in the modern world humans are social creatures and we need to bond with others and beyond simply spending time with people to chat and drink deeper connection needs to be made with people the quality matters much more than the quantity 
in todays societyespecially in north americait seems people have all become superficial and afraid of intimacy whether it be for friendship or romance without opening up your true self due to the fear of being rejected or ridiculed all the relationships you have with others will not be genuine and it will not be fulfilling  you are not living in the present reality you may be conscious but are you aware 
if you live in the past or the future you lose touch with the present reality that disconnection will cause longing which can only lead to dissatisfaction and loss of joy 
the lure of nostalgia and daydreaming of a better life or an improved world is actually quite insidious because of how intoxicating it is when your mind drifts to imagining a pleasurable experience or a more exciting life you are tricked into thinking that the longing is happiness itself sort of like how mirages work on the contrary studies have actually shown that you are actually happier and more productive when you focus on what youre doing right now even if the task is boring so stick to the reality and forget about your fantasies either make things happen or accept that youre just wasting your time and energy on wishful thinking  you engage in junk activities im happy im happy im happy 
just as there are junk foods there are junk activities that may feel pleasurable at the time but dissatisfying and even harmful in the longrun 
ask yourself do you really need entertainment ive squandered my youth by immersing myself in long hours of digital entertainment day after day i barely even noticed that i was unhappy the whole time because i was so sedated and what did i even get out of them those were several hours everyday that i could have spent reading working out learning new skills meeting new people and experiencing the world 
the fact is giving up on entertainment has no negative impact on your level of happiness sure you might miss them when theyre suddenly gone but overall as long as you find more valuable things to do your life can only get better when you ditch them learn to enjoy things that give you value rather than seeking enjoyment in things without value conclusion 
unlike what many people today say no one deserves happiness thats something youll have to earn ill go as far as to say that happinessas defined by modern standardsisnt even necessary and hard to come by for certain individuals everyone has their own path towards living life to his unique potential and there is no universal rule that applies to all so while i havent really listed anything specific for the reader to strive towards i hope i laid out some pitfalls that you can avoid in your journey nov   corey savage",Fake

the latest batch of the podesta emails shared by wikileaks add a darker dimension if it was even possible to the sordid culture of corruption lies and depravity that surrounds hillary clinton explaining why the fbi has been calling her for quite some time now the antichrist personified  
it is a possibility that hellarys clique attends and organizes satanic rituals involving mockup scenes of cannibalism and sexual abuse involving children 
one of the emails directed at tony podesta john podestas brother contains the following sentence 

i am so looking forward to the spirit cooking dinner at my place 
do you think you will be able to let me know if your brother is joining 
this really does not sounds like much until you discover the author of this invitation she who walks in the footsteps of the beast 
this is the woman who sent the email marina abramovic dressed in red and holding the skinned head of a dead goat a clear reference to the occult character baphomet 
there is proof that the clinton foundation directly transferred abramovic ten thousand dollars in at least one instance for her services abramovic carving a pentagram in the flesh of her stomach with a blade to show her artistic side 
a selfproclaimed artist abramovic hails from serbia and regularly organizes performances and events using what she calls spirit cooking 
this spirit cooking includes mixing semen breast milk urine or fresh blood before consuming it or splattering it over various things such as lifesized representations of young children like shown below 
this performance included spelling with the body fluids the following stanza 
with a sharp 
knife cut deeply into the 
middle finger of your 
left hand 
eat the pain 
other examples of her art nowadays any revolting expression of bad taste if sporting the correct pair of problem glasses include public dinners where politicians hollywood stars singers and decision makers gather to eat cakes that depict a naked human corpse or feast on the fake i hope by all that is sacred blood contained in a coffin where swims another human body celebrities that use demonic symbols in their persona such as lady gaga rush to participate to abramovics events another heavy user of the occult symbols jayz is a big fan of marina 
these codes are all directly copied from rituals such as black masses or sabat night reunions and popularized by figures such as aleister crowley from whom abramovic draws direct inspiration 
it is part of this growing phenomenon where the elites and celebrities close to power get caught intentionally or not showing symbols celebrating the ancient babylonian rites or the worship of the devil on november the th clinton chose jayz in a last bid to draw crowds to her empty rallies coincidence innocent children involved in that mess 
there is hard evidence that bill clinton traveled at least  times sometimes without his bodyguards it is all in the pilot logs to billionaire and convicted pedophile jeffrey epsteins island on board his plane dubbed the lolita express as it is in this plane that the guests could allegedly have sex with minors 
with this in mind it is disturbing to notice that other podesta emails refer to children as being the entertainment at pool parties almost entirely attended by middleaged men involved in politics other emails involve strange references to food such as pizza cheese  worth of hot dogs for a party that attendees dream of and recipes that many sources suggest are code words for orgies involving minors and extremely young children you can read more about it here  the whole clinton bag of crooks reeks of unnatural sexual behaviour and reproachable acts and we will certainly know much more in the days to come as hillary clinton is still under fbi investigation as we speak this follows the scandal surrounding huma abedin clintons right hand and confidant and her estranged husband sex offender and champion onehanded texter anthony weiner it will take some time before they go through weiners  emails and decide of a course of action regarding these dark revelations and other atrocities of the clinton crime family la plus belle ruse du diable est de vous persuader quil nexiste pas drawing by ben garrison 
these heavy accusations of satanism remind us of the sexual blackmail practices said to take place among the popular hiphop and hollywood communities as roosh described in his related article  or other rumours linked to suspicious reunions involving the secret ceremonies of the elite such as the ones of the bohemian grove or the rothschilds parties of the s 
if those recent speculations turn out to be true it could have the effect of a bomb and mean a revolution 
observe the symbols of cannibalism eerily similar in the three following pictures those are respectively a scene of the rothschilds surrealistic bal a painting hanging in john podestas office and one of abramovics dinners

"a gateway between western and eastern europe lies on the charles river in the czech republicprague its been a western tourist hotspot for many years now many people consider it a city overrun by the westerners ruined and no longer worth it
ive spent the last month of my travels here in prague and have had a good opportunity to contrast to a place further east ukraine 
with that being said here are  observations ive made about prague
 yes its overrun but 
that doesnt mean you cant find places that arent overrun yes if you choose to stay in prague zone  youre going to have a drastically different experience there will be hoards of people with selfie sticks and fat western girls wobbling all over old town blocking the already narrow streets
if you head out to prague    etc youll have a much different experience youll get to meet some locals try beer other than staropramen and avoid the throngs of tourists
of course its important to note that prague is a beautiful city its natural to want to see some of the sights if you choose to go this route theres simply no way around it
 the reaction from locals changes over time 
simply put locals are used to westerners and most of them roll their eyes at them however once they know that youve laid down some semipermanent roots theyre far more friendly
just the cashiers at the market below my apartment have done a complete  on me in the few weeks ive been here it went from a general coldness that they show all english speakers to genuine warmth
 the beauty of the city is unreal 
this is my third time in prague and im still blown away by how beautiful of a city it is from the castle to the riverwalks to all the colorful buildings its just a very pleasant place to be there are a lot of beautiful cities in europe but prague is definitely near the top of all of them
you cant really blame people for wanting to come and see it
 cheap by western standards expensive by ee simply put if youre looking for shortterm rentalsyoure getting hosed and theres not many ways around it prague landlords know the power of western currency and know that the shortterm stag parties dont mind blowing it
its far far cheaper to sign a lease for a   or  month period
a meal in a nice restaurant will probably run you between  usd this is incredibly cheap compared to places like italy spain or london at the same time its definitely a bit more expensive than places such as kiev budapest or some cities in poland
if you want actual numbers id say its about  more expensive than kiev probably about  more expensive than budapest the last time i was there was april  so keep that in mind and just marginally more expensive than poland
of course as i keep harping on this its going to get cheaper the further you go from the old town area
 the girls 
i know this is probably a large part of the reason youre reading this so lets break it down the girls are hot theyre not as hot as ukrainian and russian girls but theyre a step above polish women 
at this point its easy to see that any and all local czech girls living in prague are basically immune to foreigners you arent going to impress a girl by swooping in for a weekend and renting out a great pad with a view of the old town in fact shed probably rather do almost anything but hang out in that area
however being a foreigner will give you some major value if youre living there in colombia girls will bang you just because youre a foreigner in ukraine theyll probably at least give you one date for being foreign in prague theyll do neither especially the high quality ones 
however the same things apply if youre living there or coming back consistently
plus its not exactly rocket science to be higher value than the drunken tourists stumbling around just keep your liquor in check and avoid putting a gopro on your headyoull already be ahead of the game
 conclusionis it livable 
when you come from a place like ukraine prague feels much more like home the english is better and it has a more western feel you can find the larger supermarkets and other comforts that are often rare in the former soviet union countries ukraine belarus etc
the question is whether or not its worth it to deal with what comes with those western amenitieshigh amounts of tourism and a general feel of it being taken over theres no denying that prague has probably lost a lot of luster for the adventurous single man compared to how it was  years ago
however prague is definitely a good spot for a digital nomad to settle in and get some work done the internet is fast the city is interesting and there are good expat groups that put on cool things to do
you could do a lot worse

"a favorite trope of feminists and women claiming workplace discrimination is that female staff are the victims of sexism due to judgments about their appearance but how many times have we all seen girls working in our building or out on their lunch breaks in attire more befitting of a tinder date raunchy nightclub strip joint or even the gym meanwhile men must keep their fashion within a very narrow range of acceptability otherwise they risk failing to get that fancy new job or could lose their current one
furthermore guys learn to deal with the fact that the world does judge you based on your appearance many women have zero idea about this concept only accepting the judgments they agree with or those ones that further their interests and career for those opinions they dont like they can always conveniently claim the person giving them is sexist or misogynist or just as amorphously objectifying a woman this is classic attentionseeking
attentionwhore jayde phoenix
the epitome of this growing female narcissism is a british woman by the name of jayde phoenix  touting herself as a it security expert despite her academic and job credentials being a fraction of what it means to be highly qualified or plain nonexistent she suggested a guess the number of usbs in a jar competition to promote her company with her breasts nearly spilling out of a seethrough top she looked at the camera with a lustful gaze what many on the roosh v forum would call a thousand cock stare her clothes and demeanor better suited a street hooker than a professional
as we should have expected in our troubled times the many critics of phoenixs contrived appearance were labeled as sexists bullies and misogynists she herself tried to excoriate her detractors emphasizing how good she was at her job and the professional standards she supposedly meets every day but there are a few questions both the original photo exercise and her subsequent justifications failed to answer namely
if shes so good at her job why did she need to use a seethrough bra in the picture why doesnt she wear a top size that comfortably contains her breasts rather than flaunting them why is she and not someone else in the photo though the attentionseeking of jayde and her employer first flared up several months ago the dilemma of girls like her is an ongoing one
try getting employed in an office as a man with this sort of attire baggy pants with your underwear showing 
the male office worker could be wearing black pants and not jeans like in the photo and sporting a typical business shirt that doesnt matter no white collar company worth a dime is going to hire a man whose boxers or briefs are showing down to his ass compare this to the parade of female office workers who go beyond showing their arms and the hint of a bra strap to exhibiting half the surface area of their breasts in addition if you havent already noticed the very short crop top is now a staple garment within american office unculture it is not unusual to see a large part of a womans bare stomach and back including overthetop tattoos
hawaiian shirts and board shorts 
some workplaces most notably those trying to appear hip have drastically relaxed the need for business attire but these employers are definitely in the minority a man with a penchant for hawaiian shirts board shirts or other beach clothing will find his career options drastically limited as they should be the way in which you relate to your friends or fellow tourists on a holiday is almost always far different from how you should deal with clients investors stakeholders and the like in your profession men save their best or worst hawaiian shirt for office charity fundraising days company summer parties and related functions not an average day
leather lycra or ridiculously tight clothing in general 
inasmuch as tight clothing on men doesnt tickle your or my fancy its how ironic how an obese woman can wear garments twice or thrice as closefitting in the workplace than a fit male and male office workers of the world dont even consider wearing leather pants during your next boardroom presentation the occasional gay man or metrosexual might escape sanction for some outlandish or garish outfit but most industries if they value their reputation with clients will prohibit you from donning clothing that looks like it came from the wardrobe of lance armstrong or someone from queer eye for the straight guy 
excuses for female attentionseeking are out of control it seems that lady victoria hervey and jayde phoenix read the same book
there is little doubt that jayde phoenixs employer expected a backlash against her in this sense it was a very good marketing and advertising ploy for those prospective clients who do not care about actual professionalism of which there are many as for phoenix and other women like her this situation is winwin at the very least she and those of her ilk can continue their daytoday objectification of themselves generating desperately craved male attention in particular even for girls who do not receive the publics spotlight any roadblock or mishap in their career can later be blamed on misogyny after judgments about their appearance
at best as happened in phoenixs situation she gets nationwide and even global coverage for narcissistic girls who take zero responsibility for how others may negatively perceive them this is the coup of a lifetime yet as they age and jayde phoenix looks far older than her early s expect their antics to become more strawclutching and while these girls engage in sexual selfadvancement and wage war over imaginary discriminations the vast majority of male employees have no scapegoat they can use to rationalize their failures and virtually no means of combating institutionalized prejudice against their socalled privilege
by the way is jayde phoenixs arabic necklace indicative of some work she may have done in dubai

"via ap  
donald trump was elected americas th president tuesday an astonishing victory for a celebrity businessman and political novice who capitalized on voters economic anxieties took advantage of racial tensions and overcame a string of sexual assault allegations on his way to the white house
his triumph over hillary clinton will end eight years of democratic dominance of the white house and threatens to undo major achievements of president barack obama hes pledged to act quickly to repeal obamas landmark health care law revoke the nuclear agreement with iran and rewrite important trade deals with other countries particularly mexico and canada
the republican blasted through democrats longstanding firewall carrying pennsylvania and wisconsin states that hadnt voted for a gop presidential candidate since the s he needed to win nearly all of the competitive battleground states and he did just that claiming florida ohio north carolina and others
global stock markets and us stock futures plunged deeply reflecting investor alarm over what a trump presidency might mean for the economy and trade
a new york real estate developer who lives in a sparking manhattan highrise trump forged a striking connection with white working class americans who feel left behind in a changing economy and diversifying country he cast immigration both from latin america and the middle east as the root of the problems plaguing many americans and taped into fears of terrorism emanating at home and abroad
trump will take office with congress expected to be fully under republican control gop senate candidates fended off democratic challengers in key states and appeared poised to maintain the majority republicans also maintained their grip on the house
senate control means trump will have great leeway in appointing supreme court justices which could mean a major change to the right that would last for decades
trump upended years of political convention on his way to the white house leveling harshly personal insults on his rivals deeming mexican immigrants rapists and murderers and vowing to temporarily suspend muslim immigration to the us he never released his tax returns breaking with decades of campaign tradition and eschewed the kind of robust data and field efforts that helped obama win two terms in the white house relying instead on his large freewheeling rallies to energize supporters his campaign was frequently in chaos and he cycled through three campaign managers this year
his final campaign manager kellyanne conway touted the teams accomplishments as the final results rolled in writing on twitter that rally crowds matter and we expanded the map
the mood at clintons party grew bleak as the night wore out with some supporters leaving others crying and hugging each other top campaign aides stopped returning calls and texts as clinton and her family hunkered down in a luxury hotel watching the returns
at  am clinton campaign chairman john podesta told the crowd to head home for the night were still counting votes and every vote should count he said
trump will inherit an anxious nation deeply divided by economic and educational opportunities race and culture
exit polls underscored the fractures women nationwide supported clinton by a doubledigit margin while men were significantly more likely to back trump more than half of white voters backed the republican while nearly  in  blacks and twothirds of hispanics voted for the democrat
doug ratliff a yearold businessman from richlands virginia said trumps election would be one of the happiest days of his life
this county has had no hope said ratliff who owns strip malls in the area badly beaten by the collapse of the coal industry you have no idea what it would mean for the people if trump won theyll have hope again things will change i know hes not going to be perfect but hes got a heart and he gives people hope
trump has pledged to usher in a series of sweeping changes to us domestic and foreign policy repealing obamas signature health care law though he has been vague on what he could replace it with building a wall along the usmexico border and suspending immigration from countrys with terrorism ties hes also praised russian president vladimir putin and spoken of building a better relationship with moscow worrying some in his own party who fear hell go easy on putins provocations
the republican partys tortured relationship with its nominee was evident right up to the end former president george w bush and wife laura bush declined to back trump instead selecting none of the above when they voted for president according to spokesman freddy ford
house speaker paul ryan a reluctant trump supporter called the businessman earlier in the evening to congratulate him according to a ryan spokeswoman
read the entire story",Fake
"gentlemen donald j trump is the new presidentelect of the united states though a a few results may still be unclear trump has captured the perennial large battleground states of ohio florida iowa and north carolina plus georgia and in a change not seen in more than a generation he has seized pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin
pennsylvania and michigan have not voted for a republican presidential candidate since  and wisconsin since way back in  it appears also that states the democrats thought were well and truly in the bag for them such as minnesota maine and virginia have stayed blue with only waferthin or very disappointing margins the nd congressional district of maine a state which divides its electoral votes along with nebraska has been called for the republicans for the first time in nearly  years the last time any maine district voted for a gop presidential candidate was  when george h w bush seized all four electoral votes there
importantly too avowedly liberal states have seen significant turnouts for trump for example counts so far show that some  of voters in connecticut and rhode island states with even more liberal media bias than the nation generally have opted for the racist sexist and homophobic republican candidate their votes ultimately did not change the electoral college map but it is heartening to know that even in the eye of the liberal storm plenty of people are happy to support trump this is despite them facing fierce rebukes and often enough violence if they make their views public
the clown candidate has beaten  more experienced republican challengers and now hillary clinton the most elitebacked candidate in the worlds political history
as tonights results have shown plenty of trump voters in red and blue states alike have been forced to keep their beliefs quiet media airtime for protrump views and stories has been deliberately minimized and frequently demonized by the major networks mainstream journalists such as glenn thrush  wolf blitzer  jake tapper  jessica valenti  and brent budowsky have been caught collaborating with both the dnc and clinton campaign if you believe that these two groups are actually separate this only increases the esteem in which the emphatic resounding trump victory needs to be held
and lets not forget the senate and house races after months of spineless gop cucks rushing to differentiate themselves from trump the donald has still carried them to victory in both houses of congress  the white house senate and house of representatives are all in republican hands until at least the  house midterms can you taste the very salty tears of the liberals and sjws yet
every powerful vested interest not only supported hillary but did everything they could to ruin trump yes its happening
did you see the last major hillary clinton rallies celebritiescumpolitical hacktivists chief among them lady gaga beyoncÃ© jay z bruce springsteen bon jovi and katy perry all fell into clintons corner well before their final appearances for her excoriating anyone who had the gall to support donald trump even longterm republicans who betrayed trump like arnold schwarzenegger were attacked by celebrity sjws such as robert deniro after they joined the never trump ranks as if they were dangerous saboteurs the celebrity paranoia has been palpable for months hollywood that broad industry taking in not just film stars but also singers silver screen actors and comedians has become little more than an overpaid trade union for hillary clinton
likewise every major american company that has come out for a candidate has come out for hillary plenty of neutral corporations have undoubtedly been funneling support to the clinton campaign behind the scenes as well prominent billionaires like george soros and warren buffett have done all they could to drag hillarys stumbling halfcorpse both literally and figuratively across the line whilst trump has been supported by a number of tenfigure businessmen these men are regularly attacked in the media they include the scapegoated but brave peter thiel and carl icahn
and then theres the mainstream media countless studies have indicated that about  of all journalists are liberal this overrepresentation is more salient still in the upper echelons of newsmen and women particularly prominent mastheads such as the new york times  washington post  and huffington post  plus democratic tv surrogates like cnn and nbc the  campaign has inflated this preexisting liberal bias one that plagued the two george w bush administrations but raged even more ferociously against donald trump over the last  months
all of these media elites have lambasted trump for over a year at the same time they give the paltriest coverage of the disgusting hillary podesta and dnc emails everything newsworthy on this front from the overwhelming presence of clinton foundation donors in hillarys secretary of state diary book to more recent revelations about john podestas involvement with satanic rituals has been brushed off the balcony by the wolf blitzers and chuck todds of the american mainstream media yet trump has triumphed nonetheless
the new administration must crush the criminal democratic elites and clinton foundation with the rule of law will hillary now find herself stumbling into jail
inasmuch as the clinton campaign the sjws and their big business and media enablers have been defeated in this years election they retain very welloiled and effective means for trying to undermine president trump once he takes office trumps first priority as commanderinchief must be to remove the bureaucratic apparatchiks preventing a full and frank investigation of the clinton foundation he also needs to clear the way for legal inquiries into the various criminal activities as uncovered by wikileaks perpetrated from within the dnc and hillary clintons campaign
the department of justice in particular has engaged in all manner of skulduggery most notably when attorneygeneral loretta lynch had a private meeting with bill clinton during the most crucial time of the fbi investigation into hillarys emails additionally elements of the state department illegally informed hillary about new developments in that same case enough is enough its time to drain the swamp
election night produced another curveball after weeks of calling donald trump a sore loser for him not saying if he would respect the final result hillary clinton refused to speak to her supporters and the american people it would seem that she only telephoned trump privately so whos the sore loser now
last night we were witnesses to the greatest electoral seachange in americanand perhaps globalhistory we cannot lose sight of the work to be done but for the next  hours we can bask in this unprecedented victory against all odds

"firearms panics happen over a variety of things like acts of domestic terrorism mass shootings or democrats getting elected to office though we may not have to worry about this for a few years after nd amendment enthusiast donald trumps decisive victory last night lets cover our bases and talk about a panic if future democrats are elected
what is a panic for ammo and firearms a panic is when people go and buy items just to have them because they are worried that there will soon be no more or it will be illegal to buy and sell such items but maybe not to own them already as most americans still believe in the no ex post facto laws part of the constitution
adding to a panic is speculators who buy from retailers who are roundly shamed if they raise their own prices only to resell privately at much higher levels while this is legal it certainly isnt ethical or a decent thing to do and these folks deserve being shamed and mocked at every opportunity
lastly the gun stores or sites inventory cannot handle the flex in the buying demand nor can the manufacturer and an artificially contrived panic creates a real scarcity that can only be corrected by the panic running out of steam as everyone buys what they consider to be enough and natural undercutting resets the price back to lower levels
some prices never return  long rifle ammunition has still not totally recovered from the damage old brock the islamic shock obama did to it with his multiyear championship of best firearms salesman ever and it may be even worse under the bitch in chief
so what gets grabbed in a panic what should you get what should you count on still being available weve got three categories guns ammo and componentsaccessories
guns anything thats big on the liberal hit list is a first target for a ban so its a first target for a panic look for things that are popular with the right and scary to the left also look for things that are modern no one is going to ban the m garand anytime soon
evil features matter more than destructive power anyone who knows anything about guns knows that the ak and the ar fire intermediate cartridges that are puny enough to be considered inhumane in several states with which to hunt deer as they lack the power to kill the animal with marginal shots however theyre black and have mean things attached to them so theyre on the shit list while a nice blued with wooden stock scoped bolt action rifle in a magnum cartridge capable of wrecking your world from twice the distance that an ar can pull is safe as it looks traditional

they have to be popular to the left to get noticed rifles like the fal and anything based of the ghk action simply dont have enough exposure to get targeted unless they pull something sweeping like the usc  r rules again the mini  and the ma might be safe maybe
for pistols pretty much any semiautomatic of the polymer age is fair game to want banned oftentimes stupid rules like restrictive magazine sizes get pushed s hi powers other old domestic semiautos and revolvers should be safe expect the libtards to go after glocks and the like
shotguns seem to be immune these days as theres not a whole lot of difference between a hunting gun and a combat gun other than paint and mag tube length i think the saigas are still not being imported and its about the only box mag fed one out there but anything else makes a good home defense gun that should also be immune to the ammo panic portion as well
ammunition range full metal jacket and defensehunting hollow or soft point cartridges in popular centerfire calibers and  long rifle will almost literally evaporate from your local store and online and its probably beginning as i write this
oddly enough only certain rounds will suffer panic buying for rifles its limited to   and  traditional hunting rounds like   and  do not seem to be impacted why doesnt  get bought in a panic as the old joke goes men with s dont panic but it really has to do with the feedback cycle i mentioned at the start if theres little demand it cannot exceed the instore supply so the perception of it being gone for good cannot occur
everything but the shotgun shell and the howitzer round to the far right will sell fast in a panic
panic bought pistol ammo is the big  mm luger  sw and  acp  will round out the affected semiautomatic rounds and there usually is a bit of a run on  magnum and  special as well mm  sig  gap and other magnums like the  do not seem to be affected
for rimfires  long rifle just goes poof while its magnum brother and smaller  caliber cousins do not seem to be as affected rimfires are not reloadable and this contributes to their overstockpiling
components and accessories most centerfire ammo is reloadable and the serious amongst shooters will roll their own for economy selfreliance and performance so the consumable components will also get some panics although ive held off on reloading articles until i get my press set back up we can hit up the components that will get panic bought briefly

biggest thing is primers even bigger than the bullets oddly enough the primer is the little metal cup that gets smacked by the firing pin and sets off the powder in modern cartridges and they come in two sizes for pistols two for rifles and of varying hardness to satisfy military specifications
the second is gunpowder itself fortunately theres a wide variety of smokeless powder and everyone tends to have the brands and formulas they prefer so it takes a little less of a hit than the primers the third is the bullets and since there are so many types and manufacturers they also take a little less of a hit than primers while you obviously need all three to reload bear that in mind always save your brass and anyone elses you can pick up
even though the little ones are easier to use the higher capacity ones disappear first get both
while it is always a good idea to have spare springs and small parts like firing pins and extractors that are prone to breakage the number one accessory or part to take a hit in panics is the box magazine especially high capacity ones i dont mean the  round drum mags although those do take a dive nor do i really mean the  round coffin mags but i mean the full capacity full sized pistol mags like a  round mag for a full sized pistol or a  round ar mag expect to see pmags and surplus style aluminum ar mags just vanish the gabby giffords special the extended glock   round mag is also a contender for vanishing fast in a panic
holsters slings cleaning accessories optics and ammo cans seem to be immune from panics
what to do if you already own a carbine andor a semiauto pistol make sure you have enough ammo magazines and spare parts its a lot better to have one gun with multiple mags and a lot of ammo than many guns with the one or two mags with which they came from the factory and a couple boxes of ammo
i try to have at least six mags for my semiauto pistols and at least ten mags for my semiauto rifles get some rifle mags of different sizes the  and  ar mags are fun for shooting standing up but they get in the way of prone firing and the  and  rounders are preferable
your ultimate ammo goal i maintain should be a thousand practice rounds and  defense rounds for each gun you have but in a prepanic or panic situation just get what you can at a normal price some is better than none if youre into reloading you know what to get already
if you dont own anything and want to soon refer to some pistol articles  a rifle article a shotgun article and a buying guide here consider buying some stripped ar lowers to build on a rainy day later on
build an ar and meet girls at the range
conclusion no matter who got elected i think this country is in for rough times its always better to have firearms and not need them then not have them and need them store yours safely but accessible and ready in times of need

" things america can learn from hungarys resistance against the migrant masses  things america can learn from hungarys resistance against the migrant masses 
the paprika plutocrat is a spicy capitalistic hungarian blogger follow his unyielding assaults against cultural marxism on his blog paprikaplutocratcom november   politics 
on the  nd of october hungary has seen a stunning manifestation of national unity as  of votes cast on a referendum regarding the euimposed migrant settlement quotas were declared a strong and undebatable no now the hungarian national parliament works at incorporating the referendum results as an amendment to the countrys constitution while some leftwing news outletslike the guardiancelebrated the supposed inadequacy of the referendum it is beyond dispute that the message of the voting is strong and firm 
here are five lessons we can learn from this monumental stand against globalism  democracies need strong leaders 
wimpy western politicians would have their voters believe that personality does not matter strong witty and masculine politicians are often depicted as exponents of a fascistic personality cult nowadays it seems not much distinction is made between being a macho and being a nazi 
in reality all great western democratic leaders were strong menand sometimes women winston churchill charles de gaulle david bengurion ronald reagan and margaret thatcher were not known for being timid politically correct politicians who would retract and apologize for every past comment that theyve made do you think that todays eu politicians and western leaders could have beaten hitler or won the cold war 
hungarys viktor orbÃ¡n might have some faults but he is certainly not a shy and weak politician who lacks magnetism even his opponents will grant him that he has a rare political talent and an almost visionary skill for seeing future happenings think of how one year ago hungary was the first european country to build a wall to keep the migrant wave out today most countriesfrom austria to great britainfollow his lead 
just listen to his  th march  speech made on hungarys national holiday commemorating the countrys  freedom fight against the habsburgs look at how he is standing in the rain without some guy holding an umbrella over his head this man has speaking skills grand views and balls 
the idea that western democracies can function with leaders who have the charisma of a damp rag and the appearance of a lowgrade bank clerkto quote nigel farage who has so sharply put it to herman van rompuyis a lie and has no foundation in reality democracy is about the masses the masses need inspiration and leaders democratic leaders therefore have to be strong and need game themselves 
i am personally a friend of monarchies and i have libertarian arguments for it but as long as the western world believes in democracy we cannot have cucks and wimps protecting it  liberty is protected by the rightwing 
anyone who believes in game enjoys the fruits if western liberal capitalism like it or not yes the modern world has its faults but freedom of speech freedom of sex life freedom of entrepreneurship and freedom of travel are all essential parts of our lifestyle of course these are tenets that the left hates today in fact if you want to live free and live a masculine lifestyle the liberalism of today is certainly not your friend 
therefore im going to write about liberty and not liberalism one can debate the difference between these terms in short what i mean is that the left today doesnt want you to be free but wants a politically correct nanny state to control and plan every move you make and punish you if you do not oblige 
the right however still stands for the basic concept of personal liberty that we have grown to love and respect hungary has been criticized a lot by leftwing groups for having curbed some freedoms i will agree that some of these state actions were unnecessary and hardly defensible but hungaryand easterneuropetoday still has more freedom than some corners of the ohsoliberalandtolerant western world 
in hungary universities rarely propagate the debased agenda of social justice wars cultural marxism is regularly attacked and barely tolerated feminism is rare and marginal and the country is overwhelmingly conservative and right wing the governing party with twothirds of parliamentary seats is centreright the largest opposition party is openly farright in the capital city of budapest one of the best and cheapest cities for nightlife and gaming in europe you will certainly not be prosecuted for stopping hot girls and asking for their numberunlike some western cities  minorities are misled 
the hungarian pressmuch outside of the view of the grand world due to our rarely known and complicated languagehas been in throes for the past few months about the migrant crisis like most eastern european countries hungary barely has any immigration or muslims in fact if theres a black person on the street people will often turn their heads 
debates that have been present in the western mediaabout muslim integration terror and islam palestine and israel have only recently surfaced in the hungarian press minorities of course have been misled by the leftwing press into believing that the migrants were refugees poor victims whom he have a responsibility to assist the jewish press meaning official jewish congregation organs not conspiracy theories and lgbt groups voiced their concern for tolerance and nonviolent communication 
it is probably not a grand revelation to most readers of this site that muslim immigration brings little good to minorities as milo yiannopoulos said in a lecture of his the muslims are not on top of the oppression ladder but they want to kill all the others on the oppression ladder minorities have been misled into following the agenda of the political left the sight of hungarys gay public personalities demonstrating for letting in muslims in front the parliament is a clear proof of this  feminists love islam 
feminism in hungary is a rare bird but it does exist one such radical marxistfeminist made the news when she openly argued that there could be no terrorists among muslim refugees this of course was before the paris and brussels attacks many of the perpetrators of which arrived as refugees through hungary a few days ago i stumbled across the facebook page of another fine specimen this hardly attractive girl celebrated the empowerment of the hijab which according to her was a beautiful expression of females voluntary decision to defy the dating market 
describing such violent and shameful oppression of people as voluntary selfempowerment is crazy feminists live in denial of facts and the recent alliance between crazy radical islam and marxist feminism only proves that neither has any love for western culture  eastern europe is still ok 
the western media gleefully celebrated the fact that with a voter turnout of a little more than  the  limit of required turnout was not reached according to hungarian laws however a referendum with  or more electorate turnout is valid even if not politically binding the hungarian government will soon amend the constitution to declare that brussels cannot force the country to take in immigrants without the consent of the people 
such a policy is clear and sound the message is that eastern europewith all its faults economic lagging and sometimes real intoleranceis still a better place to live for masculine men that many a place in the western world here masculine lifestyle is appreciated donald trump has grand supporteven viktor orbÃ¡n voiced his good wishes for the republican presidentelectand feminism has failed to win any serious ground 
eastern europe is still not lost and hungary is certainly among the best options for men of game today",Fake
"there are some things that we have learned about the united states from this election well need to keep these in mind as we make efforts to return sanity to society
the federal government has been corrupted probably the most shocking lesson of this election is that the entire federal government has been coopted to serve a single partythe democrats the best example of this was the behavior of fbi director james comey the fbi is part of the executive branch of government so comey reports to loretta lynch who in turn reports to obama despite this fact one expects that the fbi be allowed a high degree of discretion to honestly investigate individuals regardless of which political party they belong to after all the us was founded upon the idea that we are all equal before the law
comeys actions reveal that the fbi has thrown equality before the law out the window at first the fbi investigated clintons use of an unsecure personal email server to conduct national business while she was secretary of state but even though clinton apparently violated several laws that have gotten other people severe jail sentences comey exonerated her back in july with a hand slap
in a move that surprised everyone comey reopened on october th the criminal investigation of clinton after  emails state department emails were found on pervert anthony weiners computer trump supporters rejoiced and hillary supporters expressed outrage but the white house calmly called comey a man of integrity did they know something we didnt
it turns out the fix was in from the beginning because just  hours before election day comey exonerated clinton again  the fbi director likely intended to clear clinton of wrongdoing before the election to defuse donald trumps criticism of her
the big lesson is that the law is applied selectively wealthy politicallyconnected people dont need to play by the same rules as everyone else unless this situation is corrected it means the rule of law is deadand that is a very grave lesson indeed
the elites are in control but elites want you to believe they are super smart and super powerful like the great oz
ive written many times about the control that globalist elites exert on the country through their control of the media educational institutions and politicians through the form of bribes donations cushy job offers speaking fees by controlling the flow of information and setting the narrative the globalists are able to control the masses like cattle the good news is that their control is not complete they are not omnipotent
the weakness of the elites has been demonstrated in three ways the first was with the brexit vote when prime minister david cameron agreed to hold a referendum on the uks membership in the eu he never dreamed that britons would actually vote to leave all the polls at the time showed that any movement to leave would go down in flames still through the work of men like nigel farage and boris johnson the british populace voted to leave the eu the brits on the leave side had to endure being called racist and look past polling that said they had no chance to win
the second way was the campaign of trump himself the gop had planned a coronation for jeb bush the rest of the gop field was me too candidates who were virtually indistinguishable from jeb trump came in with an uncompromising message and crushed jeb and the rest of the little jebs the elite plan to have hillary versus a weak conservative was completely thrown into disarray by trumps campaign even if trump has lost the general it is still a victory because now instead of seeing the great oz we see the globalists behind the curtain
the third manifestation of the weakness of the elites is the rise of the alt right a tiny group of young people on the internet was able to quickly wake up large segments of the population only a year ago terms like nationalism and globalism were rarely heard in the us now we have grandmothers in texas tweeting about how we need to lay the axe to the globalists
the overall lesson is that we should not fear the globalist elite they exist and they are able to fool a majority of the population but not all of us with sound strategy they can be defeated
the elite have completely divorced themselves from nonelites 
in the past europe had an aristocracy this aristocracy had a close relationship with the rest of the people in the country the aristocracy was expected to defend the nation in case of war they also had the same religion as the rest of the country we already knew that the modern aristocracy of the globalist elites has no responsibilities toward the rest of us but thanks to wikileaks we have now learned that they dont even share the same religion
wikileaks revealed that hillary clinton and her campaign manager are close friends with marina abramovic a serbian artist who performs occult rituals she calls  spirit cooking  spirit cooking appears to be set of magical rituals that use bodily fluids such as menstrual blood urine and semen to achieve certain goals usually sexrelated it also involves at least minor sacrifices one recipe calls for cutting ones figure and eating the pain
while spirit cooking is certainly grotesque it is not my intention to focus on it except to point out that it has become a sort of initiation ritual into the us globalist elite hillary clinton john podesta jayz and beyonce lady gaga and gwen stefani have all attended these rituals and i would not be surprised to learn that many other politicians ceos and bankers also participate getting invited to one of these spirit cooking sessions means that you have gained entry into the wealthy elite in the us there are probably similar groups or rituals for the modern day european elites
there are several things at work here most of the spirit cooking participants probably dont believe in the efficacy of the spirit cooking ritual it is more like a college fraternity initiation it only means something in terms of ones social standing also the satanic imagery of spirit cooking and its sexual overtones are big middle fingers to christianity which our elite regard as the religion of the unwashed masses
in both of these ways our modern elite have separated themselves from the rest of us they dont share the same destiny as us if the country starts going to hell the wealthy elite can just pick up and move to another country or they can live in small heavily guarded compounds untouched by the damage their policies have caused and they even lack a common morality with us in their own eyes their wealth has somehow put them beyond the traditional moral code that guides the rest of us
the fact that the elites have no regard for the rest of the country does not bode well for them the aristocracy of old knew that their fortune was bound up with that of their countrymen the modern elite lack this wisdom once enough of the hoi polloi realize it it is only a matter of time before these pseudoelites are deposed from their pedestal
conclusion with trumps election the problem of federal government being used for political purposes will be mitigated however the problems with our indulgent pseudoelite will continue to be a force that prevents the patriarchy from returning in any case we can be grateful that the election of  has exposed some of the cancers that are eating away at our society

"why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society why socalled intellectuals do more harm than good to society 
andrÃ© is a young european who left his decaying country in  for greener pastures he enjoys exploring subterranean places reading about a host of interconnected topics and yearns for tradition november   culture 
the existence of intellectuals is more ubiquitous today than ever many are those who contend for public attention credibility and money as a reward for their wits not to mention the very status of intellectual yet the existence of such people is far from selfevident for centuries traditional societies barely had anything or anybody that looked like modern intellectuals and this did not prevent them from lasting hundreds or even thousands of years 
so as we elaborate projects and ideas for reforming the depraved societies of the empire of nothinga necessary step if we want a lasting victoryan important question must be confronted do we need at all what has been called intellectuals during last centuries and if we do not what should we have instead the origin of modern intellectuals 
at the heart of modernity lies a deep crisis before it western europe was united by the same christian faith and a basic agreement on the place of economysubordinated to guilds and the rights of the average producer 
when modernity reared its philosophical head through renÃ© descartes a prominent thinker of the seventeenth century the old continent was in a much more problematic state christianity had splintered into various opposing faiths whose intellectual opposition was shaking everything to the core we have been told that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a glorious new flourishing of intelligence but in fact thinkers who actually lived at this time had quite a different impression 
the irish bishop george berkeley  criticized how the practice of philosophy had become on his age synonymous with getting embroiled into thousand scruples prejudices and errors of sense a situation he attributed to the wrong use we make of our faculties likewise the scottish philosopher david hume  scolded his contemporaries for being too eager to criticize the systems of others for the sake of pushing their own on the scene that is a mutual hypercriticism that led to a general lack of certitude about everything 
there is nothing which is not the subject of debate and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions the most trivial question escapes not our controversy and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision disputes are multiplied as if everything was uncertain and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth as if everything was certain amidst all this bustle it is not reason which carries the prize but eloquence from hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds 
the first precursors were honest in their endeavour to solve the crisis descartes berkeley hume and many others genuinely sought a grand encompassing theory that could resume with all controversies but soon the very controversy became an institution a whole market of ideas was growing in which more and more lettrÃ©s started to see an opportunity to make a name thus earning fame social standing and sometimes money hume could not help himself soon after criticizing those who fed the crisis by attacking the others systems while promoting their own he was doing the same 
such was the socalled enlightenment the further undermining of any spiritual philosophical or cultural unity by ambitious individuals ready to hustle for notoriety they would be experts at flattering the powerful mocking the catholic church fiddle fashionable themes and witty prose and more than everything else rationalizing their activity as a progress the very expression enlightenment stems from their willingness to market themselves to the posterity the intellectuals bread and butter 
it can be noted that from the amateur gentlemen of the eighteenth century generations of scientists have sprang up some of these characters were mathematicians engineers doctors or dedicated observers of nature and they all contributed to improving general human power over matter  but make no mistake even science needs problems and unknown stuff to justify careers and research thus following a headlong rush dynamic at its side the literary intellectuals need more problems so they can have the opportunity to sell themselves through claiming they want to solve them 
the momentous crisis turned into a crisis structure and the structure turned into a mark of the modern west where god ceased to speak the modern talking head took more and more territory and wrote dozens of books trying to prove he was the embodiment of progress it doesnt matter if problems are genuine or artificial intellectuals need them like a blacksmith needs iron 
two typical intellectual characters are voltaire and Ã©mile zola both were gifted writers both were charming and witty both managed to write about matters that were actually relevant to their times and both have used a trial with political overtones to make a show of themselves not so incidentally both were french and participated to the furthering of a twisted literary chauvinism 
voltaire took advantage of various trials to claim that the defendants were accused because they were protestants inside a catholic country the infamous affaire calas  from the name of a father who was accused of having murdered his own son was used by the shrewd philosophe to sending pathetic letters to the upper crust of the society stirring the public opinion pressuring magistrates until the fatherwho had been convicted and executed after a thorough investigationwas rehabilitated two centuries and a half later young frenchmen are still taught voltaire was a champion of truth justice and reason whereas he was more like a playwright who peddled influence 
zola more than a century later did the same a jewishfrench captain alfred dreyfus  was convicted for high treason after he allegedly communicated secret documents to prussia years later some new evidence seemed to indicate that dreyfus was innocent and that another officer had leaked the documents at this very moment zola published an incendiary article jaccuse  where he spat on the judges and cried about the injustice of the affaire  eventually dreyfus was rehabilitatedand the army the patriots and the catholics were shamed through a neverending media discourse that casted them as villains of the whole story 
voltaire and zola played the same role in a narrative of the exact same kind we are taught about a situation of injustice where the majority of the population is oppressing an innocent group through an innocent individual and crooked institutions fortunately a heroic talking head rises miraculously converts the opinion to recognize the poor innocent victim as such the talking head is crowned as an awesome thinker beyond boundaries whereas some are fairly vilified as oppressors and the poor victims rehabilitation is also the victory of reason justice and progress 
thus the intellectuel in the most typical sense is a highly paradoxical creature who becomes taught in classes after having seemingly rebelled against dominant institutions teenagers are led to think that heroic and highly intelligent individuals can turn the tide of unfavourable opinion provided they follow a mysterious sense of history there have been a lot more intellectuals than the mere classics and often those rejected by the official narrative are more interesting than those inside whos gonna pay 
even if you are gifted with words and language being a talking head does not pay much would anyone be ready to pay you for giving an opinion no matter how elaborate on anything the problem of money is a good starting point to connect the dots voltaire was close from wealthy protestants bankers one of whom even helped him to obtain a house in geneva and zola was a rotschild protÃ©gÃ©  both of them contributed to tarnish catholicism and most of their own people in other words they served interests that could pay themthey were sellouts 
today some bloggers happen to earn money as independents especially when they found themselves a niche yet independence is scarce way too many people would like to live from their wits and even more obtain recognition as intellectuals more than often intellectual types turn into teachers journalists or even marketersthus depending upon an institution that pays them 
in north america the war against whites and masculinity is massively subsidized  whether in the academic or in the media you wont easily find a job there if you take a critical stance on cultural marxism and in case you wouldnt be selfhating enough they are already replacing you with minority individuals who are rewarded for spewing wordy venom daily 
old marxism was wellaligned with the interests of intellectuals as a class not as individuals it handed them an official status and flattered their ego by casting them as the vanguard of progress keynesianism triumphed for the exact same reason as it justified the creation of a bloated state where modelobsessed nerds enjoy a tremendous power over those who produce actual wealth intellectual types historically joined the left because it gave them a status money and moral recognition 
but the whole marxist vocabulary of progress and emancipation dissimulated what seems glaring today namely that intellectuals were recognized and paid not because they were enlightened or bright but because they were an efficient tool of destruction 
the conservative right has often lacked a milieu for intellectual types the average conservative was reluctant to pay someone he saw as a parasite such a lack pushed a number of high iqs to the arms of the left who made an establishment out of them and paid them to enforce globalism antiwhiteness antimasculinity pathological altruism transgender madness politically correct repression and so on intellectuals were never paid to say the truth they were paid as tools who performed a primarily destructive social function 
if we happen to beat cultural marxism what shall we do with intellectual types if we are to dismantle globalism and build healthier societies we have to think about what we will replace the bobo leftist establishment the intellectual mediocrity and spinelessness of the average conservative is no solution a truly traditional society would likely have initiates something akin to high priests and knights in lieu of vacuous and coward talkers how exactly we go there or how exactly this could look today is another question conclusion 
the french essayist alain soral once famously said a journalist is either a whore or without a job this is even truer for most intellectuals sold as they are to a destructive left or more seldomly to the inefficient right 
culture is overrated what the mainstream refers to under that name is a giant matrix full of lies taboos and the snobbery of talking heads who end up lying to everyone or believing into their own bullshit no wonder why the shrewd robert greene advised to be an intense realist one must cultivate inner intuition and situational awareness not to fall prey to some of the claptrap that constitutes at least eighty per cent of current mainstream culture 
the previous generations could join the cultural marxist establishment and pretend their destructive egoladen works were progress to our generation this is impossible either we stand up for our very existence even if we must go against more than two centuries of manipulations and lies or we resign ourselves to an ignominious death before we take the power back a shared awareness must be stimulated and this is where we enter in direct conflict with the wellfunded antiwhite antimasculine establishment types whom we must beat on their own field once and for all bonus  quotes about the intellectuels 
some of the problems that modern philosophical thinking puts forward appear void of any importance and meaning modern philosophy features a range of issues that merely stem from an equivocal stance and the confusion of different viewpoints these issues only exist because they are poorly framed they have no fundamental reason to exist in many cases defining their statements more precisely may be enough to make them disappear plain and simple if modern philosophy did not strive to maintain them because it makes a living out of ambiguity  renÃ© guÃ©non introduction to the study of the hindu doctrines  chap renÃ© guÃ©non young 
philosophers care much more about putting forth problems no matter how artificial and illusory than about solving them they also strive to link their name to a system that is to a strictly bounded set of theories they would own and consider as their nothing more than their own work hence the desire to be original at any price even if the truth must be sacrificed on the altar of said originality a philosopher who cares about his repute does better by making up a new mistake than by repeating some truth that has already been expressed by others renÃ© guÃ©non the crisis of the modern world  chap renÃ© guÃ©non older 
the most evident feature of modern critique is the lack of principles and of authenticity its greater preoccupation consists in being brilliant in appearing original from the point of view of those who embody this intellectuality the catchy line the dialectical or polemical posturing well noticed by others have a much greater value than truth ideas when they use them are nothing but a pretext what matters is to look intelligentjust as to the mainstream politician the ideology of a party is essentially a means for career the vanity fair the most deleterious subjectivism often verging on pure and unmitigated narcissism are essential components of this phenomenon the critique is a scourge of modern culture an epidemic that was born out of bourgeois society concomitantly with the commodification of culture in normal traditional civilizations one could find creators artists and those who would judge the works without intermediaries the sovereigns the patrons and the people our times have witnessed the appearance between the public and the creators that cultural pimp that cheeky and presumptuous parasite we call a critique  julius evola the bow and the club baron giulio cesare evola

"the celebrations have ended and weve all come to absorb the fact that donald trump is our next president an outcome that many of us have aggressively worked for in the past several months now that weve gotten what we wanted its time to describe exactly how a trump presidency will improve our standing
if the president can say it then you can say it 
the biggest effect well see is the death of political correctness we now have a shitlord for president who has insulted ugly women as fat pigs and whose private macho talk which all masculine men have done was relentlessly attacked by the press but not punished in the voter booth this means that when you talk like trump the first thought your listener will have is he sounds like the president of the united states
what excuse will they now have for limiting your speech if one man was able to gain the highest office in the land because of it either trump was elected because voters liked a person who makes those kinds of statements or they didnt care enough that he made them whichever explanation you accept means that the will of the american people has stated that you can exercise your free speech your opinions and your desire to flirt with attractive women without having to obey a speech police force that evaluates everything you do based on how offensive it is to a kaleidoscope of races and loony identities you can begin removing your politically correct filter
im in a state of exuberance that we now have a president who rates women on a  scale in the same way that we do and evaluates women by their appearance and feminine attitude we may have to institute a new feature called would trump bang to signify the importance of feminine beauty ideals that cultivate effort and class above sloth and vulgarity simply look at his wife and the beautiful women he has surrounded himself with to remind yourself of what men everywhere prefer and not the beauty at every size sewage that has been pushed down our throats by gender studies professors and corporations trying to market their product to feminist fatsoes  the president of the united states does not see the value in fat women who dont take care of themselves and neither should you
liberals will be forced to tolerate us in a way they didnt have to before 
there are so many of us that we can ease out of the closet and not be afraid of persecution like before what are they going to do fire everyone who supports trump accuse every man who voted for him of rape the way the establishment has been able to marginalize us is to corner men individually and apply intense pressure but now we have natural allies in all men who back trump even if they dont subscribe to our particular interpretation of masculinity 
liberals will not be able to point and shriek to get you to withdraw like before they will not have easy victories by using labels like racist or sexist they will have to endure us in their midst and bite their lip when we offend their degenerate ideals knowing that the price of attacking us is becoming too costly it may be as simple as whipping out your maga hat as if its a bat signal and having fellow trump supporters come to your aid i know that if i see a trump supporter in trouble i will help him regardless of his race or station liberals will be forced to share space with those whom they hate instead of trying to exile them like in the past
it will be easier to find a fellow traveler 
men who hold our beliefs have long ago learned that we cant go around sharing them in public to those who are not vetted if youre like me you first test a new man you meet with a masculine comment to see how he responds such as remarking on the attractiveness of a woman or how youve heard of a community online that trolls liberals without mercy weve even had to devise a special pet shop code to know if a man is aware of the teachings that are found on rok or the forum  we now have a easier shortcut in trump
if a man tells you that he voted for trump its safe to say that he is favorable to strong borders nationalism  masculinity and beautiful women on a basic level you will be able to get along with this man and build a bond it also works the other way around where you bring up trump to screen out those who are offended by him its fine if someone is politically indifferent but if a man opposes trump then i have to anticipate him attacking or sabotaging me in the future i will distance myself from him for my own wellbeing
the cultural decline will halt 
we now have a president who will not encourage antimale propaganda rape culture and female victimhood while i do have minor concerns on the influence of his feministminded daughter ivanka trump will not continue the attack on men that has been institutionalized since the sexual revolution and accelerated during the eight years of obama because our current cultural dystopia is the result of intense longterm manipulation it is more than enough for trump to simply not touch the gender issue to allow the culture to return to a more patriarchal order stop feeding the rot and it will die off allowing biology to naturally reassert itself
weve experienced so many changes in the past decade that we havent had a chance to understand whats going on and adapt instead weve been reacting from one blow to the next whether its the loss of our jobs through witch hunts or the rape culture horror that has turned a banal consensual hookup into possible incarceration trumps victory gives us room to begin pushing back against the fictions that have put men in harms way
conclusion paradoxically the benefits of a trump presidency will not involve specific actions from trump his presence automatically legitimizes masculine behaviors that were previously labeled sexist and misogynist while we may still get heat for them it will be less severe and well be less likely to sustain serious damage liberals will have no choice but to silently stew on our words and we can more effortlessly connect with men not only for male bonding but also to push back against a demoralized and fractured left victories will be far easier to achieve under trump than obama
this is our moment the door is opening for a renaissance of masculinity where men can take pride in being men and the best part of it is that we dont need to wait for trump to do anything his victory is more than enough for us to apply our own individual strength in seizing the bulls horns where we can come out of the politically incorrect closet and assert our beliefs and behaviors it would be icing on the cake if trump rolled back antimasculine laws and policies but its not required because the power to change ourselves and our country is within our hands return of kings opened in  and the only surprise for me is how quickly the name is being fulfilled

today we are going to take a quick look at two epic clint eastwood films one of which is a wellknown western classic  the outlaw josey wales  the other one is a littleknown undertheradar gem which showcases the psychotic insanity of the deranged western female  play misty for me  
both of these superb rpo films will leave any redpill male feeling wholly satisfied shortly after viewing them and well thats what these movie reviews of your old uncle bobs are all about are they nothelping you find the bona fide gold nuggets amid the endlessly steaming piles of sjw hollywood crap yes indeed 
so lets get crackin  the outlaw josey wales   clint eastwood chief dan george bill mckinney john vernon 
clint eastwood directed and starred in this sweeping extremely wellcrafted postcivil war epic film and the cinematography and direction are undeniably excellent but eastwoods portrayal of the southernsympathizer josey wales who has a major score to settle after union troops burn his house down and murder his wife and children is in itself a major cinematic achievement 
out for blood and taking no prisoners eastwoods merciless josey wales thunders across the plains and prairies of the american west blowing scores of northern soldiers away in the process as he makes a desperate dash towards mexico and what he hopes will be sanctuary but wales gets sidetracked along the way collecting a stray dog and a few stray human beings as well which proves that the only thing a man can truly count on in this life is change 
theres a great scene early on in the film involving josey wales partner in crime jaimie played by sam bottoms where he starts babbling incoherently while faking a state of feverinduced delirium from underneath a blanket as the two outlaws are confronted by a pair of backwoods yahoos who are looking to collect the bounty that has recently been placed on wales head 
here we clearly see the behavior of the typical frightened woefully outmanned beta male as character actor len lesser who portrays the overmatched bounty hunter abe starts yapping and barking in a very loud voice while jerking around excitedly shortly after getting the drop on eastwoods alphamale killingmachine 
if youre an alpha male and youre in good shape youve undoubtedly seen similar betamale behavior probably at a bar when some paunchy beta asswit whos sitting with his cucked crew has had one too many beers and starts cutting you down in a passiveaggressive manner from your periphery as he barks and yaps in an excited voice about how tough he used to be or how he doesnt need to lift weights to be a man or how he doesnt think its cool to wear tight shorts a hostile barb born of envy uttered because he feels his package is inadequate yup you know the routine 
in the films wowwealmosthadagangbang scene featuring a somewhatturnedon sondra locke see above photo locke portrays kansasborn settler laura lee as shes confronted in the back of a covered wagon and dragged outside by a group of lusty comancheros which was obviously a blatant exaggeration because as we already know all rapes are committed by totally unattractive deranged horribly evil lightskinned men who smell badly and have absolutely zero neck tattoos e   etcclints character comes riding to the rescue out of the hills and guns the wouldbe rapists down which probably made sjws and feminists at the time scream with unbridled outrage at the theater screen she was giving her consent  didnt you see it  it was in her eyes  its her right to express herself sexually with however many men she might choose  murderer creeper pussyblocker  
unfortunately just like today there were feminists and sjws aplenty back in  their numbers have been growing with a vengeance since roughly the mids and after more than  years in the saddle they still keep going round and round in circles yelling preprogrammed buzzwords and catchphrases while unknowingly speeding up the destruction of freedom of speech but hey uncle bob tell us something we dont already know and yeah ill get back to the film review now 
my favorite scene in the movie occurs when josey wales who now that i think about it is a bit of a white knight hmm rescues a native american woman who is about to be doubleteamed against her will by a pair of drunken white trappers 
eastwoods maddog character ultimately gets the drop on the wouldbe bountycollectors and he blows them straight to hell in an impressive hail of gunfire which ill have to admit is pretty darned cool in itself i mean thats why we watch films like this isnt it  for the violence and the babes and the redpill messages well there are plenty of those to be had in this noholdsbarred epic western film 
maybe im going to have to rethink this movie in terms of it being perceived as a wholly redpill film clints character stepped up and stopped a potential gangbang as well as a threeway and nobody asked him to do it so this might have been a sly hollywood warmup for the series of blatant white knight films we see today but i dont really want to think that way about clint so i wont ill just gulp down a quick blue pill right nowah much better 
i mean clint played dirty harry callahan for chrissakes in a film that i will hopefully be reviewing at a later date if i dont get hit by a truck driven by an illegal alien whos sporting  arrests for murder while having no drivers license or lynched by a swarm of rabid sjws who are on the hunt for any white male who isnt a media ceo or a billionaire 
the film bogs down a bit after about the twothirds mark in my opinion but it still gets high marks across the board in every other critical category if you havent seen it rectify that soon you cant miss by watching this topdrawer rpo film for men  play misty for me   clint eastwood jessica walter donna mills 
unless they are overthetop laughingly ridiculous obviously fictional slasher films redpill movies like this one just dont get made in hollywood any longer 
when you think of clint eastwood you usually think of dirty harry  or the outlaw josey wales  or unforgiven  or gran torino but clint made a few obscure films that were both solidly red pill and truly excellent movies although theyve been swept under the rug and locked away in the film vaults by todays liberalleaning filmhiders 
in this welldirected highly suspenseful thriller carmelbythesea disk jockey dave carver clint eastwood lives a freewheeling alpha male lifestyle regularly banging out an assortment of hot women who listen to his live jazz broadcasts on a nightly basis carver is living the dream pounding most of the available hot babes and thoroughly enjoying his rightfully appointed alpha male privilege or is that white male privilegeersjw moment there sorry 
that is until jessica walters psychostalker character evelyn walks into his life 
now you may have encountered a few of these yourself or maybe its just me sometimes i think i have an invisible sign on my forehead that only the initiated can read which proclaims if youre hot and insaneim your guy but clint eastwood shows us exactly what its like to be pursed by an attractive psycho female stalker from writing creepy notes to him in lipstick on his mirror to cutting up his clothing to attacking his cleaning lady in a fit of jealous rage clints diskjockey character quickly begins to realize that he bit off a hell of a lot more than just pussy when he started banging actress jessica walters batshitcrazy evelyn 
ive always had a feeling that actresses who were really good in these psycho roles were just being themselves but i could be wrong about that i was wrong once beforeit was in the third grade and she didnt really love me be that as it may jessica walters really brings her agame in the role of the totally unhinged evelyn if youve ever had a relationship with a woman like this one watching the film will send chills down your spine and result in some serious flashback imagery 
have you ever done thiswhat clint is doing in the above photonamely hold and comfort a crazy woman who somehow managed to weasel her way into your life by skillfully turning you into both an enabler and a caretakerif so i definitely feel your pain and ill bet clint has experienced it a time or three himself or he probably wouldnt have done this film 
play misty for me is absolutely worth watching for myriad reasons but the most important reason of all i wholeheartedly believe is because it will clearly demonstrate to you in no uncertain terms the subtle and overt signs that a man absolutely has to be able to recognize in order to avoid being blindsided by a psychotic unhinged female and for that reason alone its a mustsee classic no doubt about it when clints character ultimately gets revenge on his tormentor at the very end of this excellent rpo film youll feel all warm and fuzzy inside tooand in a weird viscerally satisfying waywhich makes the whole experience just that much more gratifying 
by boycotting all modern sjw hollywood cinema you are sending a message to the power structure that is loud and clearyou are not being fooled by their deliberate attempts to poison peoples minds and socially engineer them to be pussified dumbeddown bluepillsucking robots 
always research the plot lines of any films for which you are seriously considering buying a ticket or renting on dvd and if you smell an sjw rat dont spend your money its that simple in the end its just like investigating a potential ltr candidate you have to conduct your due diligence otherwise you might just get taken for a ride",Fake

there have been few true upsets in our history caesar crossing the rubicon wellingtons victories at assaye and waterloo and washingtons victory at yorktown over the most professional army in the world it is often said that when general charles ohara who had the dubious distinction of surrendering to both george washington and napoleon bonaparte surrendered cornwalliss sword the band played the world turned upside down 
today the establishment and the intellectuals cannot help but share a similar sentiment as cornwallis or ohara did at yorktown and i fully admit in spite of my vote for trump i fully expected him to lose the polls his  negative approval rating and the sheer forces of the media the fbi and even some republicans were arrayed against him my skepticism of trump was not his ideas but his chances of winning the election myself and other conservative intellectual skeptics who voted for him were wrong 
i am one of the intellectuals who expected a trump defeat ive been studying politics history and economics for years reading countless books on the matter from the prince to freakonomics to the wealth of nations 
and i was wrong it was a canadian housewife and an iranian pickup artist who called it correctly for trump trump beat the odds he beat the intellectuals and made the establishment babies in the hands of a giant as was said after napoleons resounding victory at austerlitz in  
the left is currently in panicmode in an attempt to explain how they lost they are calling trump supporters racist sexists homophobic and even sex offenders but in the end it was this same blindness that made them psychologically incapable of defeating donald trump trump was immune to almost all conventional political weapons trump won because of the following 
 the left seemed far more interested in calling trump and his supporters racist than saying something of substance 
 outlets such as the new york times did blatantly stupid crap like try to blame the nra for the orlando shootings and even tried to call them terrorists in this they beat even trump in outrageousness they thought the american people were stupid so they just lied to them and said fuck it those peasants will believe anything we write 
 all trump had to do was call them on their bullshit and call them liars and he was  right the msm has lied to the american people this entire election cycle subsequent to every terrorist attack perpetrated by a muslim the msm continued to push the narrative that home grown rightwing terrorism is the real problem trump called them on their lies and the american people who are tired of being lied to by the msm cheered him on even if he had a few issues with the truth himself 
 the democrats ran the absolute worst candidate possible hillary clinton had negative approval ratings that rivaled trumps own and she was bland and she couldnt decide if she was a moderate or a firebrand progressive and she is corrupt and lied about it stupidly thinking the american people were too ignorant to understand that putting classified information on a private email server is a recklessly irresponsible thing to do 
 trump knew how to communicate with people he knew that whites without a college degree were tired of being talked down to by progressives on the left and genuine intellectuals on the right like myself i freely admit i am guilty of this when you study two thousand years of philosophy economics and rhetoric cicero was particularly effective it is sometimes frustrating when people dont approach a situation in terms of axioms and proofs the working class that built america go by what they feel in their gut and often times they are right 
all in all the left failed because they failed to understand america they bought into the idea that americans are stupidhaha americans are not stupid they may not be smart but they sure as hell know when a liberal taking head is lying to them about now the nra is basically the taliban in an obviously biased hit piece hillary took working class americans for granted and she lost this should stand as a parallel for black americans whom the democrats also take for granted 
i am pleased that donald trump is now presidentelect he wasnt just a candidate he was the anticandidate he did everything a politician should not do he used vulgar language he talked freely about his ideas he made no pretense about being polite to those who are destroying america he turned weaknesses such as his spotty track record into strengths that would have ended any other candidates campaign he was the uncandidate america needed 
i have high hopes for trumps presidency in spite of my tepid support i see trump as a president who can do a lot of good and has the potential to do more good than any president of recent memory 
first trump spat in the face of pc culture and won just as scott walker took on the unions in wisconsin and cucked them by winning the recall election by getting more votes than he did in the previous election trump defeated the sjws if trump can keep this up we can achieve a major strategic victory in the war against political correctness and get back to a concept called actually being correct 
secondly trump is an unapologetic nationalist he loves america and doesnt give a damn if you think howard zinns a peoples history of the united states is a great book the department of cultural guilt that has infected schools in america teaches children to hate their own country i look forward to seeing trump abolish the practice of teaching children that the founding fathers were evil racists the british empire did nothing good for the world and that america is the greatest evil the world has ever seen 
lastly trump is the antithesis of everything the social justice warriors stand for a successful alpha male who tells people to go fuck themselves and still gets elected i hope to see a rise in masculinity in america studies have shown that testosterone levels are down among the american male population this should rise under trump as men embrace their masculinity instead of hiding it for fear of being accused of sexual assault 
i was a trump skeptic i underestimated him i didnt disagree with him on much perhaps maybe  of his platform but i had little faith he could pull it off and i was vocal about my concerns regarding his electability but like the liberals i was wrong and a canadian housewife and a former pickupartistturnedconservativephilosopher were  right 
i recall something i told a fellow soldier while on a long boring convoy operation in iraq when a genius says something others say wow that is way above my head but when a true genius says something others say wow why didnt i think of that before trump is a true genius he stated the obvious to the american people and made them believe he wanted to make america great again and i think he genuinely does he didnt use fancy graphs or focus groups he spoke the truth without political correctness 
and now he is presidentelect",Fake
"home this month popular why its absolutely worth it to learn game why its absolutely worth it to learn game 
jon enjoys helping others evolve into their best selves on his blog masculine development and recently launched his ebook on  strategies to develop your masculinity november   game 
after my previous article  which advocated that men learn game as a form of selfdevelopment i got a good amount of disagreementmost of it was not inaccurate the majority of rok readers are becoming less and less interested in learning game simply because western women are not as attractive as they once were 
this isnt to say that weve abandoned learning game as a whole certainly we still want to get laid and eventually find a girl for a relationship but nonetheless there seems to be a large portion of the manosphere which simply doesnt believe that game is worth it anymore 
in this article i would like to present a very realistic and objective perspective in regards to learning game in retrospect my last article may have been too focused on the positive aspects i do not wear the rose colored glasses in regards to the game in fact its quite the opposite 
as a veteran myself im quite aware of the troubles that men can encounter when learning game ive been slapped for making mildly offensive jokes ive had drinks thrown on me ive had guys threaten to slit my throat and more despite this however i still believe that it is  worth it to learn game beginners hell how dare you try to ask me my name you fucking rapist 
i believe that the reason why most men dont feel that game is worth it is because they experience difficulty getting over a period known as beginners hell this is when youre just starting to shrug off your feminist conditioning  and you havent developed the confidence or game that you need to succeed 
most beginners walk around not really knowing how to talk to women  how to carry themselves or how to flirt in general because of this women will typically have one of two responses they pity you and ignore you they lash out and berate you for being a creep or weird 
of course you may get the occasional girl whos drunk enough to be into you but these are few and far between for the most part the beginners hell phase of learning game is absolutely horrendous 
you will be sometimes be targeted by club douchebags who will either confront you or use their superior social intelligence to embarrass you and on the rare occasion that you do manage to get a girl talking to you hell come over and steal her you will have women smack you ignore you and tell you offagain its called beginners hell for a reason s who think theyre s 
this initial difficulty in learning game is only compounded by our cultures general lack of femininity it is extremely obvious to anyone with eyes to see that women in our culture are encouraged to be less and less feminine as time goes on the once praised virtues of nurturing empathy and kindness have now been replaced by resting bitch face sociopathy and social climbing 
this coupled with the fact that women experience an endless supply of beta orbiters means that theyve been conditioned to believe theyre highly sought after goddesses who can use men like tissues without any sort of social repercussions and in fact theyre sometimes praised for doing so 
this is perhaps one of the biggest obstacles to newbies struggling to learn game couple this with severe approach anxiety a complete lack of masculinity and a weak body that hasnt been trained and its very easy to see why most men dont see that game is worth it the turning point 
once one gets beyond this initial bump however most of game is smooth sailing once the newbie has learned how to fix his lack of masculinity how to balance assertiveness with consent  and has improved his game in general he enters what i call the turning point 
the turning point is essentially that point at which learning game is no longer a struggle but its actually enjoyable this is due to several key lifestyle and mindset shifts which take place as the newbie gets more and more success such as drawing state from within rather than from without being in a state of abundance rather than scarcity improving other areas of your life which creates an upwards spiral 
if youre a newbie struggling to learn game and you dont feel like its worth it i fully empathize with your painthe problem is that when you dont have much game of course learning game will be hard because you get stuck with the bitchy fat girls 
when you start to develop the three characteristics that i mentioned however a cascade of effects starts to take place that catapults your game to the next level this allows you to pick and choose which hot girls you want rather than being at the mercy of the ugly  who might want to come over and hang out internal vs external drawing of state by my age you realize that bitches aint shit but hoes and tricks 
the transition from drawing state from outside of you to drawing state from within you is literally the difference between a guy that doesnt pull at all and a guy that can pull victorias secret models 
let me explain women typically draw state from without this means that their emotions are governed by their environment this is why they respond so much more to social pressure than men why they just want to dance when a song they like comes on and its why theyre generally so emotionally volatile 
due to their changing environments their emotions change rapidly as well this is why they want men to draw state from within or in other words not be affected by their outside environments this is why women are repulsed by men who care too much about their opinions its indicative of a man who draws state from without 
as a man drawing state from within has numerous benefits the most obvious of which being that youre perpetually in a good mood once you learn to make this shift and learn to be happy regardless of your external circumstances women will pick up on it like a hawktheyre very attuned to this type of thing and youll definitely notice a difference in their behavior 
this will get them vying for your attention which will start to give you tremendous power this will make game fun which will lead to even more women in your life which will begin the start of your upward spiral the beginning of the upward spiral 
once you begin to make this simple mindset shift game will no longer feel like its not worth it you see game feels like its not worth it when you have to put in a huge amount of effort for a below average looking girl with a horrible personality but when you start to get to the point where you can put in a medium amount of effort for a very gorgeous woman thats when game starts to be fun 
this basic mindset shift of learning to not care what your environment is like and to simply be happy by yourself will create a chain reaction within your life first youll start to get much more women much more easily this will allow you to start a harem which will keep you in a perpetual state of abundance until you find a girl you want for a relationship 
this state of abundance will amplify your game by about five fold women will sense that youve got a ton of other women vying for your attention and they will do the sameits like a magnet that just draws them in plus if a girl does or says something that you dislike you can simply kick her out of your life since you have so many other women 
then when you start to have so many women in your life youll start to friend zone hot girls for the social benefits  because you simply cant handle sleeping with all of them theyll invite you to parties and try to hook you up with their friends and youll receive many of the social benefits that they do game is worth it it just sucks at first getting over beginners hell is a lot like this once you get to the other side its all downhill though 
as i have made clear learning game at first is a huge struggleyou will encounter massive cock blocks a lot of negativity from women and not to mention youll have to deal with all of the white knights too but if you can learn to get over this initial beginners hell as ive coined it you will see the other side of reality that most men are shielded from 
i realize that it can be very difficult to learn game at first and can feel like it isnt worth it but if you make a decision to put in the effort and learn it your world will literally be x better than before if youre struggling with learning game initially be sure to maximize your appearance 
get some height increasing soles read through some of the style articles on rok get a good designer haircut and learn to perfect your appearance at least as much as you can consider taking some martial arts classes to boost your confidence as well 
ultimately however if you want to learn game and experience what its like to have dozens of hot girls hitting you up you just have to bite the bullet and go out go clubbing go to bars go on trips to las vegas or miami approach women during the day and approach them during the nighteventually youll get over this beginners hell and will experience an abundance of women in your life",Fake
"buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression buzz aldrin is a warning of how success can lead to depression aaron clarey 
captain capitalism is the resident economist of the manoandrosphere he is a misanthropic hedonist nihilistic cynical type but he keeps getting proved right every day he is the author of  enjoy the decline   worthless  and  bachelor pad economics  his newest book is  the black mans guide out of poverty  he also runs the advisory  asshole consulting  you can read his daily rantings at his blog captain capitalism  november   masculinity 
buzz aldrin and neil armstrong are household names because they were the first men to land on the moon and while neil is perhaps the moreremembered of the two because he was technically the first to land on the moon buzz is just as remembered because of his unique name while i bet most of you dont know who the third guy was but technicalities of who landed where first and who had cool names aside buzz aldrin will forever be one of the worlds greatest historical figures because of his unrivaled accomplishments and will die a better man than the vast majority of us 
but did you know buzz aldrin was an alcoholic and after retiring he fell into a severe depression and after his divorce his days consisted of drinking alone in his apartment fetching kfc and booze until he entered rehab 
its a hard fact to believe where a man who seems to have everything fame a superaccomplished career and least of all the titaniumstrong professionalism and selfdiscipline to become an astronaut yet he ends up down depressed drunk and perhaps even suicidal like any other ordinary piece of trailer trash but while it doesnt make sense at first and you cant see how this relates to you realize theres a very good and simple reason for this fall from great heights the buzz aldrin syndrome 
understand as we use the internet to accumulate the wisdom and knowledge to rocket past our contemporaries and excel in life a problem is festering that you are unaware of additionally much like alzheimers it is not prevalent today but as humans advance more and live longer it will become increasingly common therefore we have the option to identify it today prepare for it now and thus avoid the pain and insanity that comes with having a problem we cant identify 
or 
we can have it devastate our lives later 
it is the buzz aldrin syndrome 
the buzz aldrin syndrome is where a man achieves such greatness such accomplishments in life that he is truly unrivaled and peerless while exhilarating at first perhaps even earning one fame riches and fortune the success also unintentionally alienates the person from the rest of society at the time buzz aldrin only had three or four other astronauts who he could really talk to confide in and relate to the remaining  billion people on the planet at the time were just starstruck wideeyed sheep alas buzz aldrin could be surrounded by scores of fans at a party but still be completely alone mentally 
the syndrome is also exacerbated as ones pinnacle achievements in life are likely correlated with retirement you typically progress in your career right up until the day you retire however here you leave the environment and network youve come accustomed thrived in and derived your entire agency from thus in a very short period of time you go from the center of attention the life of the party the engine of the machineto a retiree in california drinking scotch and eating kfc longing for the days you could go back to the office again without the environment you derived all your worth and value from you lose purpose in life you lose mental stimulation you lose your peers and very likely sink into a crippling depression the perfect storm 
there are seven factors that when combined create the perfect storm for the buzz aldrin syndrome to form and most rok readers either have these traits are affected by them  technological advancements 
technology has always advanced but in this particular case it affects us in two specific ways making living expenses cheaper and allowing for more and easier ways to make money 
as opposed to the s most of a mans life was spent toiling in the field he didnt have time to contemplate loftier or heavier subjects much like the purpose of life what is mans reason for being etc you had to worry about the plague tetanus your wife dying in labor and whether thered be enough crops to survive the coming winter but today through economics capitalism agricultural technology etc a single man can basically eat for nearfree at walmart or the local grocery store 
technology has also freed us from work not so much from the fact we have to work but in terms of how much time we need to spend on it in order to survive no more than a decade ago a young man had to work  hours a week  for a commute and likely for an inept baby boomer boss who was never going to let you get past the cubicle plantation now with the internet not only can a man give the proverbial finger to rush hour and a commute but his boss as well making whatever minimalistic modicum of money he needs to survive through online entrepreneurship in short it has never been easier to satisfy maslows first three and vital hierarchy of needs freeing a mans mind to pursue his own excellence not to mention ponder his point and purpose in being here  minimalism 
it is no secret that red pill men practice or at least pursue minimalism we know that material things do not matter as it is the love and friendship from our fellow man friends family and loved ones that matter most you know that it would be nice to have that shelby super snake mustang but youd never trade it in for a lifetime of conversations and cigars with your best friend additionally we value our freedom above all else and refuse to subjugate ourselves to becoming debt slaves by buying things we plain dont need 
jettisoning these material desires liberates more of our finite lives from work and a commute to once again pursue our passions our fields our adventures and our lives in simply refusing to buy a mcmansion and take on a car loan we guarantee we will live more interesting and rewarding lives than  of our peers  avoiding divorce and unwanted children 
further saving us more time is the disproportionate number of us refusing to have children or marry in fear of divorce and for those of us who do marry we are fully aware of what to look for more or less immunizing us from divorce  knowledge of women 
to be blunt and honestly assess the good the manosphere and red pill community have done we have saved the lives of millions of young men and prevented older ones from wasting what remains of theirs if i were to estimate it every boy born today will save at least a decade of time that would have otherwise been wasted at nightclubs chasing tail dating the wrong girls and perhaps even marrying the wrong ones 
being a product of the s i have often talked with my gen x peers where we estimated what we could have done had we not wasted the s and s chasing women we were either never going to get or would regret catching we could have easily had doctorates houses built by our own hands much better careers not to mention better mental health as we would have avoided all the batshit insane women we sifted through young men today especially those who consume the red pill will easily have a decade of time on us by simply learning from our mistakes   selfimprovement 
unless you are in the virgintow community you know how important selfimprovement is to a mans life you have this one finite life on this planet and not only is it imperative you enjoy it but you must ensure it is a masterpiece of art in whatever endeavors you choose to excel in this may not land you on the moon but you will achieve greatness and excellence in some capacity or another music literature innovation philosophy being a good dad something you will not idly stand by sitting on your ass majoring in sociology or collecting a welfare check as you knock up baby mama after baby momma you will be notable and leave a positive legacy on this world  entrepreneurship or stem 
most of you know not to major in stupid worthless shit  you also know that for the majority of us entrepreneurship or selfemployment is the only form of employment that we can tolerate because of this two things will happen in your life one you will save an inordinate amount of time spent trying to make a go at a career that just isnt in demand in the real world you will work as an engineer a programmer a doctor or some real professiontrade which will not only pay you a handsome wage but make your life incredibly easier two at some point in time you will come up with an idea that will either cement your success in your career or outright launch a successful entrepreneurial endeavor this will free you from your dependence on traditional employers ensure your financial future is sound but it will also likely lead towards you achieving your legacy in excellence 
in the veritable sea of liberal arts majors not one of their millions will ever make anything of themselves they will simply waste away doubling down on masters degrees and doctorates in their hopelessly worthless fields worse they will be crippled until death with student loans and inadequate compensation as they beg and vote for other peoples money they will die like most unmentionable irrelevant and forgotten 
you will not  a high intelligence 
to make all of this a reality you need the raw intellectual capacity to bring this to fruition while no studies have been done if you have the independent mindedness to be reading rok id estimate the average iq of rok readers to be  however keep in mind while being highly intelligent is an asset it is also a curse  like rok you are on the fringe and because of that you are not only going to receive an inordinate amount of flak from the rest of normie society but relating to the rest of it let alone finding a healthy and rewarding social life in it is going to prove next to impossible 
when you combine these traits and conditions you have what is arguably the perfect environment for a great life to form you need very little to survive because you wont waste your resources on frivolous material things in life you also have very little liabilities or responsibilities not only because youre a minimalist but are likely not going to marry or have children the lions share of your time and energies can be dedicated towards achieving excellence and greatness in your life 
and if youve done it right youll be two decades ahead of your gen x peers since you avoided worthless degrees and leapfrogged your philosophical understanding of life you will be accomplished you will be successful you will have paid a fraction of the mental toll to get there and you will indeed be an amazing man the worlds most interesting perhaps you have reached the so called finish line much earlier and faster than buzz aldrin 
and thats when your real problems start you werent meant to be here 
understand that while the goal of man was to secure unlimited food resources and security so that he may pursue an unlimited and happy life the human mind has no experience being here the entire existence of humankind has been struggle suffering fighting and striving for such a life but also   of the time failing  and over the course of human history the human brain has had  million years experience and conditioning in failure not success 
this leads to an ironic and perhaps the most tragic instances in human experiences a man finally gets what he wants wealth health success excellence legacy everything but upon attaining it he cant enjoy it because the human mind is not programmed to he not only realizes this rare success doesnt result in happiness or a perpetual lifelong glee that will see him to his grave but theres nothing left to conquer theres nothing left to do the game of life is over and like red dead redemption it gets mighty boring just riding your horse around after you conquer the game 
worse because of the unique characteristics required to attain this excellence any man lucky enough to be this successful is in one way or another ostracized from the rest of his peers professionally romantically intellectually some way or another to be in that   you have to be a statistical freak alas you get to suffer the true symptoms of the buzz aldrin syndrome 
peerlessness  while your friends are pumping out children or your colleagues are trying to get out from underneath their mcmansion mortgage and impending divorce you may be avoiding these dreaded fates but you are also alone no longer are these the college days where your intellectual peers in equal lifecircumstances can hang out chat philosophize and in numbers that seem endless slowly but surely they will get picked off like german messerschmitts in wwii by the forces of life and you will be left alone 
understand this has nothing to do with your pursuit of greatness or achieving excellence in life but is outside of your control as these people fall within the bell distribution curve of averageness they choose these lives meaning its not the statistical freak leaving them but them leaving the statistical freak no matter how loudly they claimed in college they were going to live life differently and dont think that you can simply recoup your former social life by joining them by being average putting on a sports jersey ordering some buffalo wild wings cheering on the local sportsball team your mind wont tolerate it 
you are peerless get used to it 
boredom  without people you get bored no matter how intelligent you are you are still human and humans are indeed social creatures as they derive their entire life value from others not things but the paradox those suffering from the buzz aldrin syndrome face is that while you would like to be social with people the vast majority of people are either too common too stupid or just too boring especially when compared to being by yourself 
go to that same buffalo wild wings to hear loud drunk divorced swpl men in their s cheer on the local swingystick team 
or read marcus aurelius  
go to a movie where jason bourne discovers another mole in the ciaagainwho set up his fatheragainwhere he drives around europe shooting the place upagain 
or binge on some history podcasts  
i know how about you go to a party where youll hear the same conversations from men about the sportsball game they just saw at buffalo wild wings as they lament their inability to get out from underneath their mortgage while the wives gossip about their painfully pointless governmentmakework careers while talking about how great the cake is 
or road trip out west and do some hiking in the desert 
the larger point is not only are the vast majority of people not intellectually stimulating enough but good luck finding enough of them who have the freedom and finances to do anything besides hit up happy hour when wifey lets them out of the house 
and then theres 
frustration  being unencumbered by the daily scourge of chores children finances mortgages and commutes your mind will be unshackled to pursue whatever intellectual pursuits it wishes to pursue youll solve world problems in an afternoon that politicians are taking eons to not solve youll come up with some and many viable business ideas discarding most of them because you have not the time to put them all into execution youll see the obvious solutions to making your friends and love ones lives infinitely better but theyll have the horseblinders on so tight theyll ignore your wisdom or youll make a great scientific discovery at work while your boss dismisses it away and threatens to fire you for having an independent thought it is simply the real world telling you you dont control everything and matter of fact most of this world was not meant for you 
obviously you can see where depression alcoholism and ennui set in you can see where the pursuit and successful attainment of excellence in life can lead to unintentional alienation and ostracization from the rest of society and since society is where all humans  geniuses or not successful or not  get their value you can see the downside to zooming past the finish line of life especially at increasingly earlier ages as technology and minimalism permit it 
the solution is in part to find quality people who can be lifelong friends colleagues peers and comrades perhaps even get married if you find the right girl and no matter what keep yourself and your mind occupied hobbies interests pursuits etc inactivity is death but ultimately what is going to best prepare you for whats coming is to simply know its coming 
nirvana and heaven are not at the other side of that finish line an active and rewarding social life full of close friends and loved ones are the not the reward for success and it certainly isnt a lifelong party until you die it is a mentallybarren landscape much like the moon a place buzz has been to both literally and metaphorically",Fake
"as i have repeatedly shown in my articles i am a fan of all aspects of fitnessnot just strength and developing muscular mass but also cardiovascular endurance and flexibility as well you likely knew this already
you are also likely aware that i have done several articles on stretching most recently the relax into stretch technique that i state can be used predominantly for lower body stretching such as the splits which are and will likely always be considered the benchmark of hip and leg flexibility
but what about upper body flexibility most people dont focus on that and that is just as important to train as lower body flexibility namely for purposes of increased athletic performance reduction of joint aches and pains and in some cases increased strength i have taught the readers some basic upper body stretches in the past such as the chest stretch and the door frame stretch but in my opinion if youre going to do any one stretch for upper body flexibility that would have to be the seated twist stretch
how it works this stretch involves crossing your legs in a manner that will be discussed below and twisting the torso while simultaneously locking your arm onto your bent knees this stretch will hit most of your most prominent upper body musclesthe latissimus dorsi the triceps the deltoids the obliques the neck and the pectorals
in addition to those visible muscles the twist stretch will work the deep spinal muscles  and even the muscles of the buttocks the gluteus maximus medius and minimus as well
many athletes perform the twist stretch particularly combat athletes such as wrestlers judokas and mixed martial artists that need great torso flexibility to escape from holds and pinfalls
sounds like something you ought to learn doesnt it but how

as i have happily admitted in the past and will likely do so again paul wades outstanding convict conditioning series has taught me this and many other exercises and i cannot advocate wades writing enough more specifically the twist stretch comes from convict conditioning   the first book deals with the core calisthenic seriespushups squats and the like i have already gone over these in detail in contrast the second book deals with static holds that develop strength and flexibility such as the lsit and todays topic
while the third book deals with explosive movements such as the back and front handsprings that will be a topic for another time instead lets go into the steps of the twist stretch
all of the pictures here are taken directly from the book
the exercises the first twist stretch is the easy twist stretch sit down on the floor with your feet extended take one foot and put it inside the other leg resting that foot next to the opposite knee as shown
now twist your body so the opposite shoulder turns towards the raised kneed ie if the left knee is raised turn the right shoulder and vice versa keep the foot flat on the ground and the knee stationaryjust twist the torso allow your neck to turn as it naturally wants to turn

then lock your torso by placing your elbow against the opposite side of the knee while holding your body up with the other hand
you should immediately begin to feel a stretch all around your torso
hold the stretch for  seconds for each side when this is comfortable for you move on
step  is the simple twist stretch which requires a little bit more flexibility place one foot over the other leg as shown above then take the foot that is not flat on the ground bend the leg back and touch the heel of that foot to the opposing buttock ie the right heel touches the left buttock

this foot position will be used for all twist stretches from henceforth
now as before rotate your torso towards the opposite knee right shoulder to left knee and vice versa locking yourself by placing your elbow on the opposite side of the knee and again supporting your body with the other hand hold for  seconds and move on
stretch  is where things become more difficult assume the position from stretch  but this time you will have to rotate the torso with much more force as the goal of this stretch is to extend your arm and touch the instep of the foot that is flat on the floor your arm wont be able to stretch on its own and i dont advise you try you will have to accomplish this with proper torso rotation

stretch  has the difficulty increase further get a hand towel or some other object that is about a foot long assume the stretching position and rotate the torso while holding said towel remove the supporting hand from the floor and flick the towel through the hole made by your raised leg obviously your hand is not extending down to your instep here wrapping the support hand around your back grab the other end of the towel this begins the stretch

each time you stretch you will assume this position holding the towel in two hands you will work your hands up and down the towel slowly bringing your hands together by gripping greater portions of the towel eventually you will be able to clasp fingers and that is the final level of the twist stretch

this process will be slow and arduouscoach wade himself admits that it took him the better part of a year to accomplish this by moving his fingers together inch by inch i myself am not quite at the final level yeta rough measurement shows that i have about  more inches of towel to go before my fingers touch but i have certainly noticed increased mobility and flexibility already
the towel stretch can be made easier by remembering to worm both hands up the towel not just one actively use both to secure deeper stretches and you will notice progress
doing even the easiest variations of this stretch will make you notice an immediate healing of the spine your back will deliciously crack and youll feel warm and limber afterwards and with practicing the more advanced variants you will make yourself more limber for whatever physical activity you engage in ranging from dancing to getting out of submission holds
or you could be one of millions of americans with bad backs and hips the choice is yours

"since we were children we have been bombarded with propaganda that romantic love is the ultimate relationship ideal hollywood movies disney cartoons and literary fiction all portray romantic love as an absolute necessity in any wedding union but how much of that narrative has been a lie is it possible that our pursuit of romantic love is actually preventing us from forming a lifelong pair bond
i began to question the notion of romantic love when thinking about its emotional root love is a fleeting emotion and like all emotions it comes and goes like the clouds in the sky why have i been taught to select my life partner based on an emotion im surely not encouraged to use emotion when buying a house applying for a job or doing my personal finances but when it comes to choosing a human being that im supposed to spend the rest of my life with im advised by the establishment narrative to use emotion for the biggest decision of them all
another major clue that romantic love is a childish strategy for choosing mates is the fact that countries with arranged marriages where partners are picked based on purely practical matters have lower divorce rates that in countries where romantic love is used to select mates        while there are multiple reasons for divorce in any society it is rather coincidental that the countries most impacted by notions of romantic love happen to have the highest divorce rates 
romance was invented 
it turns out that your desire to use love as a precondition for marriage or pair bonding is an invented construct that had roots in destroying tradition and theistic authority romanticism a movement that began in the th century put romantic love at the forefront not just for individuals but nations as well all from a central thesis of individualism it wanted you to take the focus away from boring old rules and traditions to focusing on how you feel 
the movement came primarily from bourgeois youth who used family money to fiddle away on idealistic writings
the romantic movement was nothing more than a protest against bourgeois conventions bourgeois society and morality to be extreme and flamboyant and unusual and violent even at the risk of becoming grotesque was the desire of every young romantic the romantics were in fact bourgeois origins who were trying hard to escape from their own shadows  source 
 romantics believed that men and women ought to be guided by warm emotions rather than the cold abstract rules and rituals established by bourgeois society  source 
they sound a lot like modern day social justice warriors  many of whom are trust fund babies that lash out against privilege and inequality to relieve the psychological pain of being wealthy without having had to earn it combined with the fact that sjws also trump feelings over logic its clear to see how romanticists were protosjws whose individualistic ideas are just what the enlightenment needed to complete its destruction of tradition
romantics redefined what relationships should be based on 
prior to the romantic era companionate love was the relationship form often described in literature and other historical writings
passionate love is the arousaldriven emotion which often gives people extreme feelings of happiness and can also give people feelings of anguish companionate love is the form which creates a steadfast bond between two people and gives people feelings of peace scientists have described the stage of passionate love as being on cocaine since during that stage the brain releases the same neurotransmitter dopamine as when cocaine is being used  source 
besides song of songs in the old testament  writers were not encouraged to muse endlessly about passionate love and there is zero evidence it was used as the principal factor in forming new marriages but its this passionate love that were told to strive for of feeling like youve been swept up in an exciting whirlwind before publishing the gory details on buzzfeed or in a bestseller like eat pray love authored by a woman who is embarking on her second divorce 
women of the romantic era played a big part in elevating romantic love and why wouldnt they its much more fun to get swept up in the excitement created by noncommittal alpha male than it does to do arduous daily duties before you husband king and god women were given the chance to pick between excitement or responsibility and we know what they have chosen
the works of the romantic era also differed from preceding works in that they spoke to a wider audience partly reflecting the greater distribution of books as costs came down during the period the romantic period saw an increase in female authors and also female readers  source 
the modern era has doubled down on the notion of romantic love jewish psychologist robert sternberg proposed the popular triangular theory of love  which is often used today as defining the love ideal this theory has caused immense harm for stating that all three forms of love are needed in equal measure for a successful relationship

anyone who takes an introductory psychology course or who reads a pop psychology book will be exposed to this theory and walk away thinking that passion is absolutely required in a relationship if its not there the presumption is that the relationship is no longer consummate and far short of ideal
believing that romantic love and passion are necessary in a marriage makes it that much easier to exit out of it because when a woman no longer feels passion she will walk away knowing that experts like sternberg would agree that the relationship degraded and was no longer worth saving and this is exactly what modern women are doing in droves they have shown an appalling disregard for their wedding vows especially upon realizing that they initiate  of divorces 
romanticism and the rise of nationalism 
if nationalism came out of the romantic era and passionate love was a mistake does that mean nationalism is also a mistake
one of romanticisms key ideas and most enduring legacies is the assertion of nationalism which became a central theme of romantic art and political philosophy from the earliest parts of the movement with their focus on development of national languages and folklore and the importance of local customs and traditions to the movements that would redraw the map of europe and lead to calls for selfdetermination of nationalities nationalism was one of the key vehicles of romanticism its role expression and meaning
 patriotism nationalism revolution and armed struggle for independence also became popular themes in the arts of this period  source 
upon closer inspection its easy to see that the ruling agenda of today globalism  is essentially world nationalism instead of loving your neighbor and only those who share your unique traditions or race youre supposed to love everyone in the world  because its evil to think that there are large differences between a german businessman in a hugo boss suit and a tutsi villager with a lip plate the size of a grapefruit
the romantic ideal of nationalism is not adolph hitler but george soros  who insists on loving everyone in the world from the depths of your heartfelt human compassion a nationalism based on genetics and local bonds will no doubt serve citizens better than a global nationalism where youre supposed to care for those who are nothing like you
how should men choose their life partners 
its clear that using romantic love and passion as your primary standard for longterm relationships will lead to failure and maybe even personal catastrophe youll easily come to this conclusion by evaluating your past relationships and the mistakes youve made on women who you had intense passion for
instead practicality must be the order of the day you must logically evaluate any woman you intend to be with for more than a casual relationship by weighing her values beliefs and sexual history this is easier said than done because weve been so brainwashed to believe passion is important but it simply makes the most amount of sense find a woman the same way you would find a new job or buy a new house and be wary of women who picked you based more on passion than practical matters
it may sound cold to search for your wife like you would a business partner but that is exactly what she is the daytoday life of a family home is far more business and economics than love and so you should come to the easy conclusion that thats what you must use to form a stable home
understand however that we do not live in a traditional and patriarchal society that aids us in our search for a virtuous woman instead society is encouraging women to corrupt themselves sexually and physically in the name of empowerment and independence making our search exceedingly difficult this is one of the costs we have to pay for living in the modern world some men will be able to overcome it but many men wont and will fail in their search for a woman they can create a family with
but at least we are now armed with the knowledge of what it takes to have a more successful longterm relationship its not romantic love or butterflies in the stomach but a matter of practicality logically evaluate her past her values and her beliefs to make sound predictions of how shell behave in the future from this evaluation will come a logical decision that is likely to endure instead of relying on emotion which changes as readily as the direction of the wind

"peter the great  was one of the pivotal figures of russian history his reforms were a product of his personality and his vision for what he wanted russia to become and sometimes in history personality matters more than those vague historical forces that professional historians like to imagine as controlling the destinies of men
russia in his day was still halfbarbarous to rule her he had to be an absolute monarch and never for a moment doubted his right to be so his personal habits say much about him he had little need for sleep regularly working for fourteen hours or more per day alcohol was considered then as now an acceptable escape from the drudgery of rule but he knew when to limit his intake and forbade his ministers from excessive consumption his sexual appetites were as normal as any mans but he showed little interest in the kind of conspicuous indulgence that characterized most of his contemporaries in western europe
he did make a point of choosing mistresses of lowly origin rather than from titled families he had no desire for intellectual competition in the bedroom when frederick ii of denmark teased him about the type of women he chose his response was brother my women do not cost me much but yours cost you thousands of crowns which might be better spent elsewhere

he chose to spend most of his time in the city that bore his name st petersburg he liked maritime affairs and wanted to be near the sea he disliked the atmosphere of moscow with its abundance of clergy and freezing winters it was the army that first felt the effect of his modernization programs peter introduced conscription a professional officer class and defined periods of service his naval program was less effective and most of the vessels built during his reign were not of high quality
he realized that he would never be able to make russia into a great power unless he changed the mentality and outlook of the people and like many rulers before and after him he underestimated just how difficult this task would prove to be after his death many of his reforms were permitted to wither on the vine but at least some tentative first steps had been made that future monarchs might draw inspiration from by imperial decree he banished beards in  an exception was made for the orthodox patriarch this was a shocking step in a country where whiskers had become a symbol of piety and fidelity those who insisted on keeping them could do so by paying an incomeadjusted annual tax we are told that some distraught peasants obsessively saved their shaved facial hair lest they incur some disfavor from the saints
but there was method to peters apparent madness he understood that appearance and thought are connected and that if a man wished to change one he had to change the other in  peter decreed that all royal officials had to adopt westernstyle clothing trousers and cloaks were acceptable caftans or overly oriental garb was not like kemal ataturk two centuries later he had no patience for backsliders or protesters whom he swept aside ruthlessly in social relations he ended for good the traditional practice of secluding women from public intercourse with men a habit that had probably been an inheritance from the mongols
these reforms gained peter some bitter enemies among the clergy for centuries the russian ecclesiastic establishment had held a near monopoly on education and rural social life peters reforms threatened to erode this base and they saw in him an implacable enemy of traditional belief they also suspected him of having had too much contact with western europeans a fact thatit seemed to themmade him nearly an atheist peter did not help matters by openly mocking their rituals and folkways as he saw matters it was his responsibility to bring russia up to par with the other advanced nations of the day and resistance from obscurantist clerics could not be tolerated
peter solved this problem for a time by making himself the head of the orthodox church in  when patriarch adrian died he did not appoint a successor and went one step further in  by abolishing the title of patriarch altogether in its place he formed a council of clerics that he himself would appoint with this measure the church effectively became an arm of the state ecclesiastical grumbling was audible but peter wisely refused to venture into disputes with the priests over religious doctrine he cared about power not theology
slowly he made progress in industrialization this frankly could only be done with dictatorial power and to this end he reorganized the traditional russian boyar system in place of the old aristocracy a new one arose that was based on military and civil function his rule saw some success in mining and textile work when peter died in  russia was exporting iron and statesponsored factories made modest gains in cloth manufacture protective tariffs were used to shelter the new industries from suffocating foreign competitionto pay for all this peter unashamedly taxed everyone in his realm to the limits of their tolerance state tax revenues rose from  million rubles in  to  million in  the majority of this revenue went to the military
a russian boyar
ambitious plans existed for education too peter ordered the old slavonic alphabet used by the church to be replaced by a new system based on greek letters he imported printing presses founded institutes and organized professional associations to spread the ideas that were current at the time in western europe
what was the net result of all this effort the picture was a mixed one reformers are not usually popular as by their very nature they are required to focus attentions in different directions men and horses do not appreciate new stirrups the peasantryalready used to a harsh existencefound themselves taxed to exhaustion moscow became filled with paupers who alternated between banditry and begging the nobles hated him with the same ferocity as the french nobles hated richelieu and for the very same reason because he forced them to serve the nation rather than each other
as his unpopularity grew peter resorted more and more to the whip and the dungeon to implement his designs perhaps there was no other way but at the very least his example pointed the way for future authoritarian leaders who would drag russia kicking and screaming into the modern era some of his achievements were lasting and significant and some were not in history even great men must contend with the limitations of their era and try to balance their own vision with the possibilities granted them by circumstance it is on this precarious tightrope that all great men walk

"the media doesnt even try to hide its shameless prosocialist bias these days since nobody really pays attention to them anymore you might have missed some of the more entertaining butthurt spouted by shameless propagandists posing as journalists
 election night coverage on the propaganda news channels is a lesson in hilarity when examining the reaction of lamestream media talking heads what is most entertaining about trumps ascendancy to the oval office is that it was totally unexpected catching cocksure marxists at cnn and other alphabet channels completely off guard
lets go over some of the more entertaining reactions last tuesday
 hillary shill martha raddatz breaks down in tears 
over at abc the wrinkled old hillary shill martha raddatz was at a loss for words as she attempted to perform an off the cuff hamster rationalization to fellow clinton operative george staphylococcus explaining why the bitch lost the election

raddatz looked like her mother just died as victory turned into defeat for the criminal hillary clinton shes sure to be moving from a pack of smokes a day to two packs a day as the reality of the election continues to settle into her pea brain over the next  years her tears say more than her boilerplate language ever could
 bernstein plays the race card 
to the mainstream media white people voting in accordance with their own selfinterest is racist in fact white people acting in any other manner than total subservience is racist to cnn washington post journalist carl bernstein even went so far as to say trumps election is tragic and dangerous as despondent and quite possibly drugged cnn propagandists looked on bernstein seemed most upset about trumps immigration policy proposals in which mexico will no longer be able to flagrantly let its citizens violate us immigration law
bernstein completely forgot the racism white people have endured all year long at the hands of black lives matter la raza and other black and brown supremacist groups
 chris matthews goes into hamster rationalization mode 
hamster rationalizations are usually reserved for women but effeminate lowt manlets like chris matthews also have them his first spin of the hamster wheel makes him say hillary won the debates she didnt then he says she had the best ad campaign nobody believes advertising or anything you say anymore chris then matthews says she had the best ground game she might have but she was a terrible candidate the halfman halfalligator james carville looked ready to give chris a hug as the reality of hillarys defeat began to settle in on msnbc
 the racist van jones whines about white people 
van jones looked like he needed a change of underwear as he fell back on tired old leftist talking points from the s about the evil white male especially white males that havent been turned into geldings he then goes on with an emotional overreaction to say families will be afraid to have breakfast the next day because whitey got back into office lmfao really dude
he then says immigrants are afraid now that trump is going to be president no van immigrants arent afraid illegal hordes who figuratively if not literally say fuck you to us immigration law are afraid as they should be
jones then goes on to make a supremely ironic quote as he talks about a socalled whitelash he says trumps campaign was based on throwing away some of us to appeal more deeply to others umm isnt that what the entire platform of the democratic party is van throwing away nay crucifying white men to appeal more deeply to others  your entire career is based on just that mr jones
 cbs does a mea culpa cbs published an article admitting how badly the press is biased
cbs was so stunned it did a full mea culpa on the networks shoddy coverage of the  election this stunning article entitled the unbearable smugness of the press needed to be written  years ago better late than never cbs actually echoed what we in the manosphere and altright have been saying since day one with the oped piece
this is all symptomatic of modern journalisms great moral and intellectual failing its unbearable smugness  had hillary clinton won thered be a winking we did it feeling in the press a sense that we were brave and called trump a liar and saved the republic
the eyeball network even admitted the contempt the network has for men like us
so much for that the audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate it turned out was rather limited this was particularly true when it came to voters the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him they hate us and have for some time
and can you blame them journalists love mocking trump supporters we insult their appearances we dismiss them as racists and sexists we emote on twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other and yet we reject their feelings as invalid
damn at least some people over there know why we hate them that includes this former mainstream media news anchor who defected
shameless activism got marxism its the guiding philosophy of the alphabet channels
anyone who has the capacity to perform an iota of critical thinking knows the mainstream media is not on the side of the average american it hates and seethes at traditionalists and works to tear down every institution of western civilization while attempting to impale the most hated of creatures on this planet the evil white male
the rebuke of a sorry candidate like hillary when the socialist shills thought she was a shoein caught the smug son of a bitches off guard their reactions are priceless and need to be documented and remembered these reactions are undeniable proof that blogs like return of kings and web sites like breitbart and drudge are sorely needed indispensable resources in this day and age
we have not been getting the truth from media for generations and now as alternative voices appear the rift between the two versions of reality grows wider and deeper the once mainstream media have become nothing but shameless activists for new world order socialism the election night horror show only solidifies this point
we should be proud to be activists pushing our own agenda if nothing else to balance the scales the media are not friends of the american public ultimately the tired old socialist media must be dismantled in order for freedom and traditionalism to survive

"the sad saga of john walker lindh rebel without a clue the sad saga of john walker lindh rebel without a clue beau albrecht 
my father was a highranking student radical poobah and still thinks castro is the bees knees although this makes me technically a red diaper baby i rejected all that baloney early on these days i write stories  mostly comedy science fiction  as well as maintain a blog mainly about dating advice political commentary and my writing projects november   culture 
john walker lindh grew up in the washington dc area his family brought him to california when he was ten in another ten years he would become known as the american taliban while in afghanistan he was known as sulayman alfaris one of several arabic monikers hes used over the years johnny joins the jihad there are moments when one realizes ones vacation is really starting to suck 
when he was twelve the young lindh saw spike lees rather hagiographic film biography about malcolm x that began his fascination with islam while a teenager he used the evocative email email protected and made several postings about rap music on usenet sometimes he pretended to be black even having the nerve to dis dr dre  
hort dog does hip hop no glory wack like dr dre and his madeup gangster stories sellout house nigga living honkey dory saying hes broke in his own pool doing laps all these playground mcs fall off like scabs skills disappear like alaka abracadab 
dr dres a disgrace selling out to the talcolm hell be left dead and naked in the outcome word to brother malcolm dre shirts and hats when will we see his cereal 
so whos the poseur there anyway im not sure whether to laugh at the sheer impertinence or cry at the abuse of the english language 
when he was sixteen he formally converted beginning his fateful journey meanwhile his family situation was on shaky ground his father turned gay  living parttime with his male lover  and eventually divorced 
john began his world travels twice venturing to yemen both times for nearly a year later he stayed at a pakistani madrassa in may  he went to afghanistan to fight on behalf of the taliban unfortunately for him after september  american forces went to war with the taliban he was captured on november  after his unit surrendered in kunduz 
the cia questioned him and he claimed to be an irishman that must have been an interesting conversation perhaps ach begorrah top o the mornin to ye presumably pretending to be black again wouldnt have gotten him very far shortly after the captive jihadis staged a bloody uprising  and lindh escaped hundreds died including mike spann one of his interrogators after that he was recaptured andfollowing some rough treatment not that im shedding any tears about itquestioned again he announced defiantly that he wasnt in the taliban but rather al qaeda his actions sealed his doom 
fighting for the taliban fruitcakes was a pretty dumb move on his part his actions after being captured were even dumber what could he have done differently in the beginning he couldve said he was interested in islam and his quest for discovering his spiritual roots took him abroad then he could have lied and told them he was pressganged into the taliban and he was quite happy to be freed by his countrymen 
he could have tipped off his interrogators about the planned escape attemptpotentially sparing many lives on both sidesas well as avoiding further criminal charges for himself had he given a helpful warning about the uprising likely they wouldve concluded he was small fry and let him go after that he couldve become the star of the daytime tv talk shows then he couldve given speeches on the antiwar circuit helping his jihadi buddies by saying they really arent that bad or whatever 
instead he ended up faced with ten criminal charges which couldve meant three life sentences plus ninety years finally getting smart he copped a plea for twenty years with the possibility of three off for good behavior now hes in federal prison making the news back in  by suing for the right to be allowed group prayer  what went wrong 

as bush the elder put it lindh was some misguided marin county hottubber later he apologized profusely for the remark still i have to say that bush  was onto something with that one all the criticism he got from that was because the truth hurts  
things couldve been different lindh didnt have to become a renegade if hed made other choices he could be living a happy life as a productive member of society rather than counting the days in a prison cell still his environment bears some responsibility for what he became 
he was raised in the catholic faith but a stronger grounding in itas well as explaining some of the unpleasant realities about islam to balance out the picture might have put the kibosh on his journey to jihad a liberal environment should at least be able to explain why all thats bad or has liberalism become too wishywashy to assert its own values there wasnt much chance of parental guidance turning him from the wrong path his mother converted to buddhism and his father left for the gay community 
for that matter if he had acquired an appreciation for good musicbe it mozart or metallicaperhaps he wouldnt have been so fascinated by irritating rap music what kind of white kid is so alienated from his heritage that he pretends to be black and laughably accuses dr dre of selling out on that note as for malcolm x didnt lindh have some cultural icons of his own i have to wonder if he received much grounding in his own irishamerican heritage 
all this is an illustration of what can happen when an impressionable adolescent is cast adrift in an  anything goes  environment islam speaks in absolutes enjoining right conduct and forbidding haram conduct and they fight for what they believe in i cant fault them too much for that although i disagree with their theology and actions on many points 
going further islam offers paradise for believerspromising seventy virgins to their martyrsand eternal hellfire and brimstone for the damned theres nothing wishywashy about it indeed embracing radical islam could be interpreted as an utter rejection of the anything goes world view i certainly dont agree with lindhs choices but i can see how he found that compelling in comparison to being at sea in moral relativism  
this certainly isnt the first time that people turned their backs on their countries and went abroad to give aid and comfort to the enemy jane fondas north vietnam adventure comes to mind an action she now regrets more recently there were about five hundred misguided youths who volunteered to be human shields in iraq for their pal saddam for all their posturing none of them got themselves blown up over there leaving aside the question of whether or not the resumption of war was justified  fewer social justice warriors wouldve helped cleanse the gene pool a bit 
then theres the odd case of matthew todd miller  a californian who went to north korea tore up his visa and announced he was seeking political asylum that ones an iffy case though later he said i just wanted to speak to an ordinary north korean person about normal things kids these days in summary dont let this happen to our youth they must not grow up culturally bereft 
in times past children were taught about their countrys heritage instructed in their culture and pride in their nation was instilled in them it was a given that these were presented as good things these daysat least in much of the western worldthis isnt happening we cant count on the educational systemand certainly the mediato do that any more 
because of decades of cultural marxism  young people are indoctrinated with a negative view of their own civilization all societies beliefs and ways of life are equal except yours are terrible those who dont see through that baloney end up rootless alienated and disconnected from their own culture some even end up thinking that their homeland is the embodiment of all evil while repressive regimes abroad are wonderful this is basically what social justice weenies think something they have in common with young jihadi rebels without a clue 
this will have to change of course hopefully the day will come when the media manipulators and educational bureaucrats who pushed cultural marxism are standing in the unemployment line for now well have to pay close attention to the messages that the young people in our lives are absorbing and help them learn to be secure in their faith and cultural identity teach them about their roots and why thats important dont let the tv be your childs babysitter anything goes is not a standard by which to raise our youth",Fake
"shopify erased our store from the internet while i was fulfilling  orders shopify erased our store from the internet while i was fulfilling  orders november   work  money 
to launch a return of kings tshirt shop i decided to go with shopify because of how much easier it is to launch than a selfhosted store i signed up with them paid for one year of service and did a prelaunch with a small group of readers which resulted in  orders as i began fulfilling them shopify pulled the plug on the entire store without warning both the public storefront and the administrative backend with all our data 
because of shopifys decision my customers couldnt access their order status i had no way of informing them of what happened and i couldnt fulfill remaining orders they put both me and  individuals in the lurch for no legitamate reason forcing me to threaten legal action in order to get enough information to complete fulfillment of all orders the backstory 
there are many open source solutions for hosting a web store the problem with them is that it takes extra time to create the store and maintain it compared to services like shopify squarespace bigcommerce magento and others to get the rok store up and running as quickly as possible i picked shopify because of their competitive prices not knowing that i was in for a far greater price down the road 
after i set up the store featuring photos of yours truly in our first tshirt i collected email addresses of those who were most interested with participating in the prelaunch i sent this group an email announcing the store and  of them took action ordering a tshirt or two the shirt in question 
during this time i received an email from a shopify risk analyst by the name of justin he asked me to send in identification which i was happy to do and then asked me for more information 
thanks for signing up with shopify payments and providing your id 
in order to complete this initial review and ensure payments continue to be sent to your account we would need a little bit more information 
if you could send me any documentation you may have to validate the business that would be great examples would be a business bank statement business license or business registration documents 
could you also confirm where youre primarily operating your business from 
i sent in my business incorporation documents my irs employer number designation a recent bank statement from my usbased bank and a note of how i often travel through eastern europe but that my business bank accounts and tax status all reside in the united states in spite of that shopify unjustly classified me as a foreign business and gave me no means to dispute it 
unfortunately shopify payments is currently only available to companies that are based in australia canada united kingdom and the united states so we are not able to help with payments for your site right now its frustrating for us to have to turn down good businesses but we need to make sure were abiding by both us and international regulations this means that any successful charges you have will be transferred to you on schedule but you wont be able to use shopify payments to accept any further payments  
despite the information provided our payment processing partner needs to ensure that the shops are based operating from and have a substantial presence in the united states 
ultimately their decision is final and we must respect it 
according to the united states federal government and the irs my company is american and liable to pay american taxes but to shopify im not an american business the repercussion from this was that i couldnt use shopifys own payment system shopify payments and had to pay a  extra commision on all orders but this wasnt a huge setback since there were many other payment options i stayed the course because i wanted to do an ontime opening for my readers i could always change stores later when it was convenient for me the disaster 
i have a worker based in the united states who maintains the shirt inventory and is charge of shipping them out he printed most of the shipping labels for the first batch of orders and got ready for shipment before he was finished i tried to log into the admin area of the store to monitor his progress and saw this 
the public storefront was also taken down there was no longer any way for me to know who my customers were and what they ordered i couldnt even send them an email i then received this from justin 
hello 
im afraid that after reviewing your information and website we believe your business presents a level of risk for customer disputes that we will be unable to support on shopify 
we will transfer your existing payments to you but will be unable to accept any additional payments on your behalf from shopify payments 
im sorry we wont be able to help with your business 
regards 
justin 
after i read this email i was absolutely livid ive been doing business on the internet for over fifteen years and have never had a situation where a company pulled the rug out from under me and my customers in a way that i would personally classify as fraud 
they allowed me to take  orders begin processing them and then removed all access so i could not complete fulfillment imagine if you bought a shirt from me and then tried to access the store to see the status of your order you would have no way to know whats going on and would probably think that i took your money and ran shopify created a situation of unneeded worry for  individuals while directly hurting my reputation as if im running some sort a scam operation the phone call to support 
i called support and got on the line with a level  support tech i told him the situation as calmly as i could his response send an email reply to justin this was unacceptable because politely complying with him through email beforehand had only resulted in the deletion of my entire store without warning i demanded to speak with someone from the risk department but the support tech told me there was no way to patch me through since he was working remotely i was not calling shopifys main office but someone sitting in the middle of nowhere in his pajamas 
i also told the support tech that there was no further information asked of me that this was a unilateral closing of my shop while i was in the middle of fulfillment if shopify is so worried about fraud why would they leave  individuals in a position where they would believe they got defrauded and start initiating chargebacks with their credit card companies i had no choice but to threaten legal action i told the support tech that if shopify doesnt give me a way to complete these  orders i would pursue all legal means as a response to what i saw as fraud 
the support tech put me on hold after a few minutes of chatting with the risk team he said that they have given him permission to send me a csv file of all my orders i decided that this was enough to satisfy the  individuals who purchased from me but it still didnt allow me an easyway to process exchanges or refunds if one of my customers was unsatisfied with the shirt 
before ending the call with the support tech i told him to relay to justin and his team that they have created so much ill will by the way they have treated me that i will ensure that everyone knows exactly what they did not just to me but also to my customers who had an unfortunate experience because of their ecommerce platform 
using the csv file i received i was able to contact my customers to let them know of the situation and complete fulfillment many of them have already received their tshirts in the mail the lesson 
shopify has every right to choose who to do business with and i would not be particularly upset if they said i have to go elsewhere after fulfilling open orders  but the way they removed all access from my store is absolutely reprehensible and the stuff of nightmares for a business owner no owner wants to wake up one day and find that everything is gone with no way to contact his customers i have never been treated so poorly by an american internet business before and im confident that any business who treats people in this way wont be in business for long 
maybe my situation was special as i am often abroad but shopify operates as if its customers are not even allowed to take a vacation out of the country if you log in from a certain ip address pool their algorithms go crazy and here comes justin to hit the delete button on your store with one click 
whatever the reason its important for existing and potential shopify customers to know that it doesnt take much for them to shut you down at any moment and for any cause they will take all your information and prevent you from contacting customers or fulfilling orders your only recourse to receive your data is to threaten legal action and that may be no guarantee of success if any of my friends ask me about which web store platform to use i will strongly warn them against shopify 
as for the rok store ive decided to try the open source method hopefully we will be ready for orders again within two months nov   roosh valizadeh",Fake
" ways to forge strength through challenges  ways to forge strength through challenges 
corey is an aspiring iconoclast he believes that the key to life is for men to honour their primal nature 
learn more about his views at theprimalmalecom you can also follow him on twitter  november   mind 
we modern men need to constantly improve ourselves in a hostile world like ours that tries to debase us while the lesser men embrace weakness and degeneracy we must embrace strength and discipline while whiners complain about how unfair the world is and how its better to just disengage we must engage the world with greater willpower and defeat our enemies towards this end i propose that we become both resilient and antifragile in every way possible 
the following are ways you can turn a seemingly negative circumstances into strengths  stress 
although stress has been maligned as the plague of the modern world that wrecks our mental and physical health the way you perceive it makes a profound difference on how it affects you new studies have shown that those who see stress as being toxic suffered damaging health effects while who saw it as being helpful were able to turn it into a source of energy to push them through their challenges 
so next time you feel stressed from whatever trouble you may be facing remember that it is your friend you must reframe the sensation and believe that its your body trying to help you by changing how you processes stress you can use it to succeed in life  obstacles your response to obstacles reveal the kind of man you really are 
whatever obstacles you may face in your endeavors you have two choices become frustrated and discouraged by it or see it as an opportunity to grow stronger like stress its the weaker mans inclination to view an obstacle as a confirmation of his own helplessness but you must do better and face up to whatever gets in your way use every occasion to grow stronger from your obstacles and if you arent facing enough of them in your life you need to get out and start doing more things 
how you deal with obstacle will show your true nature as a man for the world to see so dont pussy out or moan about what you must overcome instead be determined to rise above it your honor is at stake  failures 
failures are inevitable in life although you should always try your best to succeed you shouldnt be afraid to fail either just as with obstacles view every instance of failure as an opportunity to learn and adapt its not failure itself that is bad but not learning from it or giving up so easily remember winners dont quit they try to do better  rejection 
rejection is a specific kind of failure that is often the most painful of them all its especially difficult because its often unclear whether it was actually your fault or not i would say that its best to assume full responsibility for all the rejections you face and see what area you can improve to better increase your chance next time as long as youre willing to learn and as long as youre willing to try again you will grow master rejections and youll be placing yourself far above other men  physical discomfort this is why russians are so tough 
its well known that the human body is designed to be antifragile your bones get thicker with every blow and your skin gets tougher with every scrap pain and discomfort of all sorts also become more bearable the more you expose yourself to them the more harshness you endure the stronger you become over time but inversely the more comfortable you are the softer you turn and the weaker you get 
one simple method you can implement to become more healthy and energized is to start taking cold showers the benefits of doing it are many including stronger immune system enhanced mood and energy better circulation boost in testosterone level and so on if you are having trouble getting started start by doing just  seconds at the end of your usual warm shower and go from there you want to train yourself until you can comfortably stand under the coldest water for at least five minutes  fear 
you cant really turn fear itself into a positive but the process of conquering your fears can have a transformative effect on your life some of the proudest most exciting and memorable moments of my life were when i defied fears by doing a presentation in front of hundreds of people i had a terrible stagefright going rock climbing i have a terrible fear of heights and traveling for the first time by myself to a foreign country 
one thing you can do to completely turn your life around is to do what this man did and make a list of all the fears that you wish to defeat write them down in an order from the least fearful to the most and start knocking them down one by one its impossible not to become a better man once you conquer them all  anger 
like fear anger is not something you can transform into a positive trait ive heard of people transmutating their anger to rechannel the energy into other activities but ive never had it work that way however it is a good focal point to master your mind to become more stoic it can also serve as your area of focus if you practice meditation 
no matter how unpleasant your anger will teach you a lot about yourself and only if you allow it it will reveal your weaknesses insecurities and any other areas of your life in need of improvement as one of the most base and primal of human emotions you shouldnt just shirk it as something that is unneeded instead make it your friend  negativity and pessimism 
for the longest time i felt guilty about being so negative because i was constantly told by everyone else that it was a bad thing smile they said think positively they said your life will improve they said i was constantly berated for not being part of the north american positivity cult its no wonder why people there tend to say that theyre doing great even when theyre feeling like shit a habit i have yet to fix 
but in contrary to the long held belief that positive thinking and attitude gives you a better life studies have shown just the opposite forced positivity can actually harm you  for some people like me positive thinking backfires and makes things worse also badtempered people who are pessimists have been shown to enjoy more successful marriages be healthier live longer be better at negotiating and more successful overall in life so if youre a natural grouch like me its time to embrace who you are and tell the fakeass positivity people to shove it conclusion 
the road to selfimprovement is an ugly and a bumpy one i honestly cant say that i enjoy it but no matter what i know that it is a necessary part of being a man i cant imagine myself not trying to be better in spite of all the difficulties i refuse to live a life of complacency some people mock and insult our efforts  but know that their opinions dont matter lesser men have no say on what it means to live so fight on and prosper for this is your one and only life",Fake
"home this month popular are you on pace to reach your goals are you on pace to reach your goals february    comments lifestyle 
today is february   and youre one month closer to death what have you done this year to improve yourself some may say new years resolutions are copouts for actually setting reasonable goals instead of starting today we say in a week ill hit the gym and finally get ripped i like the idea of coming up with goals and plans to achieve them for january st of the next year the start of each year is a mental rebirth january  is a new snow begging for you to make fresh tracks in it a blank canvas yearning to be painted on 
however many do use new years resolutions to feel better about themselves they gorge themselves on baked goods drink heartily and fail to exercise throughout the month of december telling themselves that next year will be different and just one last time before i change this is not the case for us here at return of kings we are different  writers readers and commenters all strive to build themselves into the man they want to be 
personally i had some slipups through the month of january but what sets the determined apart from the shambling masses is that we pick ourselves up and keep pushing forward one step at a time  i started the year off strong my days and nights booked full with dates time with girlfriends reconnecting with old friends i eschewed online dating and become more social during the day time i broke prs on all of my lifts dropped a few pounds and sought coaching for the olympic lifts 
most importantly i held myself accountable for all of my actions if i ate too much drank too much or didnt take opportunities i should have i picked myself up and adapted push forward and give everything you have how bad do you want it what happens when you reach your goal do you aim higher or do you stop there and remain content with being slightly above average  if you choose the latter and have finite concrete goals you are already anticipating the day you can quit building yourself youre doomed for failuredont ever miss an opportunity to get better  take risks  analyze your successesfailures and dont stop until youve surpassed your goals then strive to be better faster and stronger 
what are your goals for  are they smart  do you have a purpose  do you want to have sex with more beautiful women learn a language  lift more weight and make more money do you have an accountability buddy or do you journal and meticulously track your progress

"gentlemen i am filled to the brim with joy we have successfully thwarted the globalists plans to ruin americaweve fought against the big banks weve fought against the satanic pedophile elites  and weve fought against the corrupt mainstream media
but the battle is not over yet we still have much to do if we wish to make america great again this will not be an easy fight for we will certainly face much resistance along the way expect the cucks and liberals to throw temper tantrums as their safe spaces come tumbling down expect the mainstream media to demonize the altright and expect the elites to do everything they can to stop us
they will not stop us thoughno we are far too powerful the wheels of truth do in fact turn slowly but alas they turn and they are growing in speed as we blaze towards victory here are four goals that we must achieve on our path to victory
 dismantle the mainstream media 
as more and more of us start to wake up the media will begin to sense thisin fact they already have have you wondered why theyve started to cover antihillary stories its because they realize that theyre losing credibility
the mainstream media is very well aware that theyre losing their chokehold on the american publics mind so in a last ditch effort theyre trying to seem unbiased do not buy into their liesits all a giant farce an attempt to regain their former credibility
over the next four years it will be extremely important to start dismantling these outlets its time to call them out for what they are start sharing altright stories on facebook and twitter get our message out there dont watch any mainstream media
dont buy mainstream magazines dont watch their news shows hell dont even pay for cable do everything you can to bleed their pockets dry
as more and more money moves away from the mainstream media it will naturally move towards alternative news sourcessites like return of kings info wars matt forney  and danger and play will become the new media
dont expect this to happen at first however in one final cry before its gory death the media will proclaim that there is a new racist xenophobic enemy that helped donald get into office the altright
expect them to demonize us expect them to lie about us to scream and shout and to protest this is fine howeverfor we are antifragile the altright is in a very unique position
any and all hatred towards the altright will be a net win for us why its simple any publicity is good publicity a single mention of an alternative news site by the msm can and often does net us tens of thousands of new viewers
in other words if they ignore us we continue to grow in power if they attack us we grow even faster they cant win
 drain the swamp 
everything that weve done up to this point to get donald in office will be completely pointless if we dont drain the swamp this is our one chancewe have four years to do this
in order for us to bring about permanent change in this country we need to hold the cucks and libtards accountable for their actions anyone who pushed the proislam agenda rape culture or feminazi philosophy must be called out for the traitors that they are
the elites the corrupt bankers and the globalists must all be brought to light in order for us to bring about true change and to prevent a globalist dictatorship from happening in the near future we must ensure that at least  of americans are aware of the elites conspiracy by the next election
this is a grass roots movement and it is growing in powerbut we must take away power from those who tried so hard to fight us now is the time to cause a ruckus and email your representatives now is the time to demand hillary be thrown in prison
every single person involved in hillary clintons private email server must be thrown in jail pedophiles and satanists such as anthony weiner and marina abramovic and traitors such as huma abedin and comey must be thrown in jail for their crimes
now is the time to clear out the murky watersto sift through the dirt and rotten garbage lurking below i believe that once all is said and done america will enter into a new age of prosperity the patriarchy will return
 normalize straight males 
for too long have men been oppressed by the very civilization which we created we have let the sjws and culture warriors back us into a corner but weve finally started to fight back
more and more men upon being exposed to the manosphere are starting to wake up and take the red pill  were starting to realize as a nation that there is no reason to be ashamed of being white or being a man
once we start to dismantle the mainstream media and drain the swamp most of this should happen naturallyit was only through the artificial social engineering that being a white male became a crime
but we cant stop hereits time to start slowly redpilling our bluepilled friends the best way to do this is simply through osmosis dont try to convince them with logic because they did not arrive at a bluepilled position through logic they did so through emotion
simply be a beacon of masculinity be confident in yourself be assertive and dont cave into ridiculous hr requests or political correctness social pressures again once the mainstream media is dismantled and the manosphere grows in popularity our movement will gain strength exponentially
the normalization of males especially white males is essential for our culture to continuethe second that we started to become ashamed of our heritage and of our nationality was the second that the cucks started closing in we cannot give them an inch or they will take a mile
this is not to say that our country shouldnt accept immigrantsif they go through the legal process how did it get so far that it became socially unacceptable to shame illegal immigrants again illegal immigrants like i said it got this way due to an overwhelming amount of white guilt do not be ashamed of your heritage men
we have made a gigantic step towards national sovereignty with donald trump being elected as president and we cannot let this victory go in vain we must push onward and continue to normalize what is normal being a straight male white or note should be the norm not being a transgender greenhaired sjw
 get the law on our side 
as our grass roots movement picks up more and more steam i believe that the pressure we create will naturally push judges and lawmakers to change our corrupt legal system
first things first we must create laws that treat men and women as they should be treated too many laws are skewed in favor of women now that women have the right to work we must remove alimonyits ridiculous that men should have to pay  a month to their exwives because she got used to a certain living situation
we must remove corrupt antimale divorce laws ridiculous hatespeech laws which infringe on our freedom of speech and ultimately sjw rape laws
i along with many other rok men have been falsely accused of rape  its time to remove all of these ridiculous laws that make it illegal for men to simply talk to women and that were built into the system by the elites in order to wage war against men
the law should encourage freedom of speech the fact that twitter has not been held accountable for banning milo yiannopoulos is absolutely absurd information and social media platforms should be held to the same standards that the american people are
google needs to stop censoring search resultsand if they dont its time for us to create laws against this type of behavior allowing google to filter search results is like a regression back to medieval times for one entity to selectively edit our version of reality is unacceptable
most importantly judges and lawmakers that have taken bribes should be thrown in jailindefinitely anyone who took a donation from george soros or any other member of the bilderberg group should be imprisoned for crimes of treason
summary 
we are on the path towards victory menbut it will not be without many hiccups the first thing that the mainstream media will do is demonize the altright but again this will only make us stronger it will expose our view points to a larger audience
expect it to get darker just before the dawn expect feminists sjws cucks and libtards to protest and scream and shoutbut it will all be in vain too many men are starting to wake up too many men are starting to see the lies that have been shoved down our throats  and there is no going back
the next four years will be more important than ever our primary objective is to dismantle the mainstream media through natural means its time for them to be exposed as the liars that they are simply eliminating the msm will be most of the battleremember this is a war of information and when the altright starts to control the news there will be sanity
we must also focus on draining the swamp we must rid our corrupt political establishment of the people whove betrayed us we must normalize the family unit and white menno longer shall we feel ashamed of our gender or sexual orientation
then from here the laws must change remember this will not be easy there will be much resistance along the way but weve come this far weve beat all odds and elected trump as the president of our nationand its time to make america great again

"one of the foundations of living a good life in todays times is having a good place to call home whether you want a solid comfortable place with which to pursue your hobbies recover from the days tribulations and just to be or whether you want a bachelor pad for your romantic pursuits or both a good home is essential to the modern man
i purchased a home and i decided to be my own general contractor for the renovations my home was an asoriginallyfurnished home of the s and i brought its multicolor painted green shag carpeted datedness up to a sharply trimmed hardwoodfloored modernity while being of a somewhat timeless style a general contractor is a person hired by the architect or engineer to run the job site source the labor follow the schedule get the materials and execute the vision of the plan here are ten things i learned as my own general contractor
 there are good contractors and there are bad contractors 
you will run into both good and bad contractors out there a good contractor does good work at good value follows the schedule and is honest and doesnt lie to you a bad contractor will do any or all of the above i fired a contractor who had good value but did poor work could not follow the schedule and lied to me i paid more for a later contractor who did excellent work hit the schedule on time and was a perfectionist give a bad contractor a second chance mainly to see how he corrects it and if he fails to shape up cut him loose
a good contractor has the correct amount of paperwork but no more some firms i turned down did things by hand and had no contractors license and that is too little whereas a firm that gives you fifteen pages of legalese allowing them to take out an uncontested mechanics lien on your home if you do not pay is too much
a lot has to do with the presentation of the representative tradesmen are naturally rough people who work with their hands but a man that does not have a good handshake good eye contact and is evasive on important details is shady
 good contractors cost more and they are busy the best indicator of a good contractor is that they have a busy schedule and i mean they are booked often a month or so in advance the guy i fired kept trying to work me in on the weekends and at night which while it seems like hes busy hes actually operating in the red and trying to use your funds to cover his other jobs
a good contractor will negotiate terms up front and not change them and he will when awarded the job put you in his schedule at an agreedupon time my best contractor was so busy that i had to do other things first before i could get his firm to bid my work and they did what good contractors do when they are too busy they turned down my work until later
 you need to establish a reputation 
general contractors in an area have a reputation amongst their customers and the contractors they subcontract to and the only difference between those that do it for a living and you is that you have no reputation
a busy contractor will work with a gc who will give them work in the future over one who will not i was an unknown so the busy guys during the busy season fall and preholidays would pass on me and work with ones they knew
however word got around to the others that i gave jobs of good scope and paid on time i hired a sub contractor for a set of jobs and once they found out who i used as my electrician it was who they subbed their own electrical jobs to they called and the electricians vouched that i was picky as all hell but paid on time and let them run their own schedule and have the run of the house at that point i was in
 good contractors know other good contractors 
reputation works the other way too a good roofer who i only turned down because he was too busy and wouldnt meet my timetable has a brother who runs the electrical shop mentioned above although you should always get multiple competing quotes bid to three two will generally respond and pick the better one the deciding factor was that his brother the roofer ran a good shop and it stood to reason he would too
my plumbers knew my ac guys and my chimney guy my flooring guys knew my kitchen cabinets guys everyone works with and around everyone else and i saved all my paperwork and contact info for all my vendors so that on any future projects i know who to call for what and even if i dont know i know who to ask for recommendations
 it will take more money than you think it will 
home renovation is expensive and its mainly for the nasty reason that once you commit to action you can get hit with extra costs you can mitigate this with good bid scopes that you give to your contractors so all parties know what is what but you will find that the home will need things you didnt think about or that the hourly rate of the laborers is higher than you budgeted or materials will simply cost more
part of the balancing act that is required is you will learn what to spend money on now and what to spend money on later right now i live in the place finally but i still have construction paper down on my floors as i have not yet bought furniture pads or rugs for the high traffic areas my bathrooms have plumbing in but no mirrors cabinets towel racks or toilet paper holders entire rooms are without furniture all of these can and should be taken care of later but things like flooring and painting needed to happen earlier
 it will take more time than you think it will you may not need something this complicated but a gantt chart shows dependency of one job on others
contractors have their own schedules and there is also the time outside the work time where they have to arrange a site visit you have to juggle quotes they have to then write you in then they do the work then theres followups and punchlists and then finally that job is done and you pay them
you cant do some other jobs before you finish the first one this is where having a master schedule and knowing who is doing what and affecting whom matters my floor guys had to have the run of the place when they were finishing the floors but they did not when they were laying subfloor and i was able to have plumbers in that day as well contrariwise i could not start the kitchen install until after the floors were done
 some of your ideas are wrong some are right i had my own thoughts about what to do with the place sometimes i was wrong it was stupid to try to reuse the baseboard that was over the carpet and put it over the hardwood even though it was the same color and i listened to my contractor and used new sometimes i was right my backsplash behind my sink was supposed to match the countertops colors and the ratio of white i wanted was correct but i was persuaded to add more by my contractor
know what is important in your vision and be able to explain your intent but the contractor might have a better way of how to do it in mind than if you had told them the how instead of the what i have a rather creative way of running the drains on my basement fixtures they did what i wanted but did it in a better way than i would have suggested and they got it almost completely right to my intent in the process
 there will be gaps in your manpower coverage 
the one thing a professional general contractor does that you as a private operator will not is do all the basic stuff themselves a gc will hire an electrician to wire fan boxes for mounting fans but he will install the boxes and hang the fans himself my electricians did install and hang them for me anyway
this was for two reasons and this is how you can mitigate having little shit jobs that no one will want to do as a single job the first is to provide all the materials yourself which also allows you to pick out what you want i had a pile of fixtures fans and bulbs laid out for them with a plan of what went where and this helped them just throw them up after the technical wiring part was done
the second reason is to provide a good scope of work will a plumber come install a single faucet maybe will he come install five and a garbage disposal certainly thats a good days work so if you have little jobs have a lot of little jobs and youll get more interest
 there are things with which you will not be satisfied good enough is good enough 
this house is old but renovated some things simply cannot be fixed without massive upheaval i cannot have perfectly flat ceilings because the drywall is  years old and it had popcorn texture on it some things i did not address i have new baseboard and new window trim but the door trim is original and has the nicks and stains of time
some things were done but were not perfect the drywall where my kitchen cabinets bulkhead used to hang from the ceiling has one spot where even after two reworks still has a hairline paint crack some of the window film has pull away lines and theres a couple things trapped under the film in places one of the toilets will top itself off for a few seconds signifying a small seal issue you cannot have perfection but you can go for reasonable excellence
 code enforcement sucks the man sucks someone called code enforcement on me and i had to go get a permit of a cost of x of the renovations cost mainly so they can jack my taxes up
i got the permit and i expect my taxes to go up the inspector was a real schmuck as most appointed officials are but the jokes on him as i only got the permit on what i had left to do and i omitted some things that would still happen but werent too noticeable
with code enforcement and county ordinances the idea is reasonable cooperation and being able to explain things away with saying you were mistaken instead of flouting the law i went and got the permit when i was busted for it but they only know a third of the story had i gotten a permit earlier perhaps whatever nosy neighbor that ratted me out might not have called at all another tactic which i will do on a future project i have planned is to get the permit months ahead of time then hit it hard over a few days and be done before anyone notices
conclusion if you have the time the patience and the skill to know exactly what you want who to get for it and how to juggle a massive schedule running your own home renovation is a lot of fun and very educational if you want it done faster and just want to deal with one person for everything then hiring a professional general contractor might be the way to go instead

" hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts  hollywood films for bluepill men that reinforce sjw values and concepts bob smith 
bob smith is a man in search of the truth his favorite quotes are were all fools on this earth and i can be no different i know its true i read it at the liebrary and the truth is not misogynistic its just the truth november   culture 
your old uncle bob is mixing things up hereand i think you will see where im going with this new angle of mine pretty quickly i have selected three sjw films to review one from the s one from the s and one of much more recent vintage from  and what might all three of these insidious hollywood movies have in common why they outwardly or subliminally program viewers to blindly adopt bluepill beliefs and behaviors thats what 
i feel unsettlingly dirty just writing about these films but somebodys gotta do it so lets get busy here and expose these three flatout unintentional farces for what they really are seize the day onward and upward or is that downwardin this case in terms of these three horrendously blatant sjw films most definitely downward  to kill a mockingbird   gregory peck robert duvall brock peters mary badham 
this multipleoscarwinning film is based on the pulitzerprizewinning novel of the same name which was written by harper lee and published in and it is that pulitzer prize and those multiple oscars that should be your first major clues that the hollywood elitists were up to no good while crafting this brilliantly clever piece of sjw brainwashing 
this wickedly hypnotic movie cleverly reinforces the statistically bankrupt notion that most white males in the american deep south are vicious stupid ignorantly racist crackers who spend most of their time ruining the lives of innocent blacksthat is when they arent shooting them down like dogs or lynching them outright the plot centers around a hardworking standup straightarrow black man tom robinson brock peters who is falsely accused of rape by a conniving whitetrash slut named mayella ewell collin wilcox whose alcoholic father bob ewell james anderson is a racist pig of unfathomably low character 
the towns sjw lawyer atticus finch gregory peck plays white knight and comes rushing to tom robinsons defensemuch to the dismay of the local good ole boysbut despite his best efforts to free the poor wrongly accused black man finch cannot hold back the powerful tide of racist anger which ultimately results in the backwater towns killer cops shooting poor tom down in cold blood a familiar theme which can be abundantly found in todays world of dindunothin black folk who are perennially and viciously gunned down by racist white cops on an everincreasing and frightening basisyawn gee never heard this one before 
im not even going to get into the rest of this mindnumbing films plot and story line because its a waste of both my time and yours but i will mention a few correlative facts here which you might find just a little bit interesting the sjwcontrolled civil rights movement exploded with a vengeance not long after this film was released and heres the redpill truth of the matter according to the  annual report on murder by the federal bureau of investigation most interracial murders in the usa involved black assailants and white victims with blacks murdering whites at  times the rate that whites murder blacks 
these stunning disparities began to emerge in the mids when there was a sharp increase in black crime against white people an upsurge which not so coincidentally enough corresponds exactly with the beginning of the modern sjwcrafted civil rights movement blacks thus committed  times more violent interracial crimes than whites even though the black population was only oneseventh the size of the white population at the time this is according to the survey highlights from  years of surveying crime victims  published in  youll have to buy the book if you want to find out the real truth 
these days washingtons sjw datagatherers no longer keep track of such  bigoted  statisticsprobably because they care about our safety so very very deeply over the years the cumulative effects have been staggering justice department and fbi statistics indicate that between  and  more than  million violent interracial crimes were committed in the usa overwhelmingly involving black offenders and white victims and more than  people were killed in interracial murdersthe vast majority of them being blackonwhite killings by comparison  americans died in the vietnam war and  were killed in the korean war 
i wonder how many additional people have been killed in america during the escalation of these deliberately inflamed race wars since  unfortunately we cant get a look at those statistics as previously mentioned because the puppet masters no longer keep such records so far as i can telland if they do they definitely dont want us to see them 
be that as it may the notions set forth in to kill a mockingbird are repulsively twisted morally insidious and patently false and if that offends anybody out there who might be reading this review that makes my entire freaking day because in the end all that should matter to any critically thinking person is the truth and what hollywood dishes out on a regular basis is anything but  gandhi   sir ben kingsley martin sheen candice bergen sir john gielgud 
supposedly as the crafters of history have quite ingeniously led us to believe mohandas k gandhi played by sir ben kingsley in this multipleoscarwinning film utilized the greatest weapon of all in his epic fight against british tyranny on behalf of the indian peoplethe incredibly effective method of nonviolent resistance 
and in the movie gandhi  there is a sequence in the film featuring a large group of noncompliant protesters as it faces down a group of security forces armed with sticks outside of a salt factory the end result being that the protesters get the holy crap beaten out of them 
in reality that was basically all that happened there was a public dogandpony show shortly after this supposedly reallife event which was choreographed by the elitistowned media and indeed in this cleverly constructed movie actor martin sheen can be seen describing the bloody mayhem at the factory over the telephone to his cohorts back in the usa sheen plays american journalist vince walker in the film 
and what sheens character witnessed and put into words and then passed along to his editor over the phone was summarily put into print in vast numbers of elitistowned newspapers as well as on film in elitistowned news reels and marketed all over the worldwhich resulted in bringing worldwide focus on the terrorist acts of the security workers at the salt factory this entire episode was allegedly a key element of indias signature accomplishment of gaining her independence from the british 
despite the fact that every single major worldwide event that finds its way into the mainstream medias propaganda conduits is either a completely staged event like the indian protesters getting beaten outside the salt mine imho or something that meshes well with the elites overall master plan or they will not even put it into print or on film to begin with  of the worlds major media companies are owned by just six major players we are supposed to believe that the elitistproduced film gandhi  depicts reallife events that occurred as the direct result of one brave man in a loincloth who stood up to the ferocious might of the british empire and brought the entire house down singlehandedly 
please youd have a better chance of talking me into using tinder 
there is another infamous sequence in the film wherein a group of hindi demonstrators is peacefully assembling in protest within an enclosed parklike area of the indian city of amritsar the demonstrators are consequently assaulted by british soldiers who open fire brutally and randomly on the assembled sitting ducks and proceed to gun down hundreds of protesters this incident allegedly occurred on april   and some estimates put the actual number of demonstrators killed at well over  
and in this single crucial very revealing sequence of the film the sobering truth is once again put on display for all to seeassembling peacefully going against the grain of the established order by utilizing peaceful protest and noncompliance within a group setting is exactly what the elite want the people to do because it makes it a whole lot easier to identify them and kill them 
in the film after the mass slaughter the soldiers commander is dressed down by his higherups for taking the law into his own hands and gunning down the peaceful demonstrators but that was all done strictly for show and this is most obviously a case of cinematic cover here as anyone who can think for themselves can easily infer who do you think produced gandhi uh that would be an elitistowned film company columbia picturesdo you really think the elite are going to pass along the bona fide solution to wiping them outuh no way last time i checked rattlesnakes dont commit suicide 
the british empire has a long and bloody history of usurping lands and the notion that the stringpullers at the very top of the greasy flagpole would be aghast at the actions of the british commander who ordered the slaughter at amritsar is comical at best 
what the slaughter at amritsar actually accomplished in addition to the massmurder of a huge swath of ardent protesters was the following 
with the complicit assistance of the elitistowned press the british commanders actions that day reinforced the suicidal notion that peaceful protest and nonviolent resistance were the keys to bringing about significant social change and throughout history other choreographed events like the slaughter at amritsar and the subsequent explosion of moral outrage fueled by the reports in the eliteowned media have continued to give rise to the suicidal notion that nonviolent resistance actually works 
which of course it does but only in isolated highprofile choreographed incidents where the outcome has already been decided beforehand whenever the puppet masters want it to appear that way to the sleeping sheepthe rest of the time it only results in massincarceration physical assault political harassment or murder on a more subtle note you might have noticed that two of the leading actors in this oscarwinning film were eventually knighted by the british empirenamely sir ben kingsley knighted in  and sir john gielgud knighted in to which i can only say i rest my case your honor  the gift   jason bateman rebecca hall joel edgerton allison tolman 
i dont typically watch modern hollywood films these days mostly because i know what hollywood is up to so i normally avoid them in the exact same way that i avoid single mothers with tramp stamps or chicks with green hair but i went ahead and checked out this absolute mindfuck of a movie on showtime the other night knowing it would probably throw me a wicked sjw curveballand sure enough it didnt disappoint 
as an aside i threw this film into the mix juxtaposed with the previous two oscarwinners partly to demonstrate how far the bar has fallen in the hollywood filmmaking industry in terms of the standard of quality they dont even try to hide the sjw brainwashing madness in their films any longer at least back in the day they could mindfuck the sheep in an entertaining and captivating way while keeping their overall intentions under the radarbut today as this next film proves not so much 
simon callem jason bateman has a horrifying secret buried in his twisted past and his wife robyn rebecca hall is clueless about the whole thing innocent white female vs evil white male the usual bullshit here the couple relocates from chicago to a suburb of los angeles where they run into gordon gordo moseley joel edgerton a creepy awkward socially inept former high school classmate of simons gordo starts dropping by the couples new house uninvited and unannounced and he does so on far too many occasions simon thinks gordons behavior is weird which it is but his sjw wife thinks gordo is sweet shy and simply misunderstood 
gordos weirdness escalates in typical boremetodeath fashion hollywood is really great at this audiencewowing technique lately until robyn finally discovers her husbands longheld secret he bullied poor gordo back in high school by inventing a story about him which centered around a homosexual relationship that gordo never had the horrendously unfair story got back to gordos father and gordos father nearly killed him 
of course simons liberal sjw brainwashed wife eventually wants her bullyboy husband out of her life forever shortly after discovering this unforgivable transgression even though shes pregnant with their first child and they were very much in love up to this point yeah like that would ever happen in real life 
the sjw bullshit meter spikes so hard in this film that youll be left slackjawed stunned and eyerollingly incredulous and if you are unfortunate enough to have to sit through this absolutely putrid piece of garbage be sure to keep a barfbucket handy especially for the endingbecause you are definitely going to need it 
hopefully its getting a whole lot easier for you to spot the bullshit that is being sold not only in todays sjw hollywood films but in hollywood films of days gone by most especially oscar winners 
the elite are always using the magic of hollywood for nefarious purposesnamely to magically instill behaviors in its audience members that will get them into trouble or instill beliefs in them that are totally divorced from reality 
doing this makes it much easier to divide the moviegoing sheep and thereby conquer them typically by race or by historical beliefs or by sociopolitical beliefs 
so do yourself and the world a huge favor and avoid sjw hollywood films wherever and whenever you can the rule is simple if its being made in hollywood today its a bpo film blue pill only and unfortunately as it pertains to movies that were made all the way back in the early s if not even further well as we have just seen the same rule applies in many cases 
by boycotting hollywood films you are lessening the degree of brainwashing to which you subject yourself simply by being alive in the world at the present time and in this particular case less is most definitely more",Fake

written in  the camp of the saints is a novel by jean raspail that predicted the european migrant crisis forty years before it began not only the actual invasion by brown migrants but also the leftist arguments that enabled it which ushered europe to its doom 
the story follows a onemillion strong flotilla of indians who are slowly making their way to europe the leaders and people of europe have decided not to stop their arrival light on action the book focuses on the mood of the pending arrival particularly how europeans were eager to cuck themselves into oblivion 
after all your helpall the seeds and drugs and technologymigrants found it so much simpler just to say heres my son heres my daughter take them take me take us all to your country and the idea caught on you thought it was fine you encouraged it organized it but now its too big now its out of your hands its a flood a deluge and its out of control  
youve gone and worked up a race problem out of whole cloth right in the heart of the white world just to destroy it thats what youre after you want to destroy our world our whole way of life 
raspail understood how the media whips the public into feeling immense guilt as a mechanism to introduce nonwhite migrants well before the globalist view on migration and equality was elucidated raspail was steps ahead in predicting what the result of it would be as if he was reading into a crystal ball he even knew that migrants would bring diseases like tuberculosis  
and all at once whole sections of new york are deserted a score of american cities watch the flight to the suburbsand half the historic paris pavement tooamerican tots in their integrated schools fall five years behind tubercular gauls flee in droves from our openair clinics  tallyho tallyho just listen to that battering ram smash at the southern gate 
the centurieslong segregation of the first and thirdworld brought great complacency upon europe no one could really get a grasp of what was in store once the thirdworld reached critical mass and started invading the west 
i can tell vilsberg continued that you really dont believe how serious the situation is after all we lived side by side with the third world convinced that our hermetic coexistence our global segregation would last forever what a deadly illusion now we see that the third world is a great unbridled mass obeying only those impulsive urges that well up when millions of hapless wills come together in the grip of despair 
in a bittersweet scene one of the prominent media leftists goes out with his wife to celebrate the arrival of the flotilla with joyous africans towards the end of the party his wife gets brutally raped by them and he eventually dies in sorrow the hordes arrival suddenly awakened all the immigrants already in the country into asserting themselves they began stealing directly from the native citizens by attacking their white privilege 
now its a known fact that racism comes in two forms that practiced by whitesheinous and inexcusable whatever its motivesand that practiced by blacksquite justified whatever its excesses since its merely the expression of a righteous revenge and its up to the whites to be patient and understanding 
what drives the maniacal leftist raspail believes its a suicide mechanism likely activated by a human organism void of spirit and with no reason to endure a cosmopolitan existence attempting to destroy its host culture is an indirect way of killing itself 
whenever the pop tunes would lose their blaring charm there was nothing left but to let oneself drown in the stickysweet syrup of human misery and despair set to music of sorts that one refuge of yearning and unfulfilled souls that had learned nothing else it never occurred to any of them to measure that notion of misery against the past or against their own wellbeing for them it was a drug and they needed to shoot up a good strong dose to keep themselves going like addicts and their heroin the fact that it was often hard to come by close to home made very little difference nothing stops an addict when he has to have his fix and poisons like that are easy to import theres never a lack of pushers besides modern man has always had tucked away in the back of his mind that singular longing for total destruction sole cure for the boredom and anguish that consume him 
the book even predicted a cucked catholic church raspail knew that every institution had to be on board with europes destruction for the thirdworld invasion to proceed seamlessly 
i came south like a lot of other priests father to hail what i thought would be mankinds redemption to welcome the million christs on board those ships who would rise up reborn and signal the dawn of a just new day 
the european women who welcomed the refugees became whores for them if you think this is too extreme consider that european women are getting raped by migrants today but not reporting the crime  yet if a white man so much as brushes past them hes accused of assault  
she died in nice in a whorehouse for hindus disgusted with everything in general and herself in particular at the time each refugee quarter had its stock of white women all free for the taking and perfectly legal  
yes the third world had started to overflow its banks and the west was its sewer 
raspail even predicted the fact that the media would elevant the interracial couplings of white women and the invaders we saw something similar recently when the german government sponsored sex workshops for migrants on how to fornicate with german girls 
ralph ginzburg the famous american publisher had printed a series of photos in his magazine eros which had caused not a little ink to be spilled they showed an interracial couplewhite woman black manin various stages of nude embrace with a caption that read as follows tomorrow these couples will be recognized as the pioneers of an enlightened age in which prejudice will be dead and the only race will be the human race 
the fleet made landfall in france the french impotent to do the right thing to save their country tripped head first into spreading the welcome mat they actually competed with each other to see who would be the most welcoming you can imagine the result when one million wretches made landfall in a country they cared nothing about the new social justice government that rose forth catered to the invaders more than the french similar to what we already see in western european nations 
in war the real enemy is always behind the lines never in front of you never among you always at your back thats something every soldier knows in every army since the world began and plenty of times theyve been tempted to turn their backs on the enemythe socalled enemy that isand give it to the real one once and for all  
when freedom expands to mean freedom of instinct and social destruction then freedom is dead 
the book itself wasnt my style of storytelling raspail made numerous detours and longwinded soliloquies that took away from the action in favor of creating accurate character portrayals its more of a mood novel than one that moved forward at an exciting pace the only flaw is that it didnt predict the rise of an alternative media that would sound the alarm bell even though an active invasion is taking place today the antimigrant side is far stronger than whats portrayed in the book 
the camp of the saints was a prophetic story that showed how the migrants themselves werent the only cause of europes destructionleftists played the largest role in ripping apart the country before their arrival a fact that many of us already know too well nov   roosh valizadeh",Fake
"i remember signing up for facebook ten years ago at this point in time the new social media site was geared mostly toward college students and it was uncommon for anyone over the age of  to have an account 
but over the last decade weve seen facebook morph into a  billion conglomerate and information kingpin acquiring massive power and wealth from the endless amounts of time users waste scrolling through their news feeds this beast of a social media platform has gone on to consume the lives of millions gather nefarious amounts of data foster unnecessary personal dramas and often cause more harm than good for its users 
it would be prudent to take a good hard look at your facebook experience and ask yourself if its something thats actually adding value to your life here are five reasons why you should think carefully before using the worlds largest social media site 
 your facebook feed is a black hole of completely worthless information 
i think its important to create streams of information that add real value to your life through platforms such as twitter feedly and youtube ive followed writers and content producers that have dedicated their lives to selfimprovement entrepreneurship higher meaning and the search for truth 
so you can probably imagine the stark difference between an intellectually curated twitter feed and the dumbeddown facebook community of people you went to high school with that peaked in the th grade 
log into your facebook and the most common information youll likely find is who got married who had kids and who got fat scrolling through your facebook feed is akin to flipping through a more personalized celebrity gossip magazine at the grocery store checkout line 
every time i log onto facebook im immediately reminded why i never log onto facebook 
 its no longer useful for dating 
in college i gained some value out of the site by using its chat feature to build up attraction with girls in my social circle and get their phone numbers 
but over the years most girls have attached the creepy stigma to guys who hit them up via facebook messenger 
in addition to that you dont really need a facebook profile for social proof as you once did since instagram is a better social media app for meeting girls  
 forfeiture of your privacy 
most people have realized by now that the first thing a potential employer will do after interviewing you is look you up on facebook theyre basically searching for any and every reason not to hire you lock your account down as best you can with privacy functions dont let that one drunk picture of you from  years ago ruin a potential job offer 
if that wasnt enough facebook has a long history of shady activities when it comes to privacy theyve already been caught accessing your location without permission we can only speculate what else theyve been infringing on

 censorship 
although facebook has a right to control the information broadcasted on its platform that doesnt mean they should abuse that right by censoring anything they might find disagreeable or offensive 
much like an overbearing parent facebook proactively controls the discourse of its children eagerly censoring content that might rub someone the wrong way facebook has so many overreaches that an entire website has been dedicated to documenting their affronts on freedom of opinion you can probably guess which side of the political spectrum they try to stifle

 it brings out the worst in people 
plenty of time has now passed for indepth research to come out regarding the longterm effects that too much facebook can have on a persons mental wellbeing it gives the illusion that everyone else has it better than you and that your life just isnt fair this is a slippery slope into a victim mindset and blaming others for your circumstances how oppressed these chronic facebook users are as they sip lattes from a comfy chair in starbucks and scroll through their facebook feeds on the latest macbook

i wont completely deny the merits of facebook if youre using it to build a brand or a business then it could be a good investment of your time simply because so many people actively use it ive also witnessed the joy it brings to older users for connecting with long lost friends they havent seen in decades 
but the truth is that in many cases facebook does cause more trouble than its worth its never a bad idea to cut back on your usage or even just opt out entirely you may no longer be the first to know about an upcoming dinner party or what brad and sarah from freshman year have been up to all these years but i suspect you might be better off as a person

it seems that we have to turn towards russia once more for our recommended daily dose of normal masculinity
as red pill and coldblooded as it gets 
brother brat in russian is a  movie directed by alexey balabanov it is seen by many as the one of the greatest gangster movie of all time and changed forever the image of the traditional justiceseeking hero
it has been a few years at least that i want to share my discovery of this film with our readers it had a tremendous impact on the way i see the world and the attitude i have towards life i was convinced of its quality of the impact it could have on the disciples of the red pill and that a few lines cannot do justice to this giant of russian cinema culture it entirely deserves an article of its own
my brother the criminal 
enter danila bagrov played by the stellar sergey bodrov who died at  at the peak of his meteorlike career many called him the russian james dean
after serving in the bloody war theatre of chechnya young veteran danila returns home in the sleepy provincial town of tula
needing money and without any solid prospects he joins his brother vytia who works as a hitman for the local welldressed businessman in saint petersburg being an expert in making rudimentary weapons and with his quick capacity of reaction and frugality danila adapts marvelously to his new occupation

after seeing the risk of a gifted concurrent stealing their livelihood the citys gangsters soon put a price on his head and send a few professionals to tie up this loose end but even after being betrayed by a mix of greed and cowardice young danila bagrov decides to take on the mob single handedly
an epitome of the russian alpha hard and unforgiving sober in words and in behaviour for whom nothing counts more than the bonds of blood and brotherhood
to err is human 
his one soft spot is the faith he has in human nature convinced that if he does good his fellow man will be virtuous in return he could not be more wrong especially with women he discovers very fast that beta moves like buying them gifts and helping them only brings him trouble or ungratefulness
what is rare and makes danila stand out is his loyalty a cornerstone of the definition of masculinity and a value that progressively vanishes nowadays his brother will do the unthinkable but after the storm clears and danila emerges victorious he proves once more his quality as a man by being magnanimous and giving him a second chance
no fancy green screen or politically correct themes 
brat is good because it is painfully real and does not embellish the lawless chaos that was early postsoviet russia this is how it felt when the wall came down everyone was trying to survive the best way they could
the odd lowquality orange filter used in the film reminds us of this period where everything was made from what people could find when the shelves where empty
you cannot go wrong with a good revenge movie and danila is an example of bravery alone and against all odds he takes on the mafia that wronged him and will make them pay
the man says it like it is his analysis of the city and its perverse influence on men is brutally accurate

danila you told me about the city about its strength but here everyone is weak
hoffman the city is a great and terrible force it sucks the life force out of the strong  turns them weak it takes away your power and you fell right in the middle of it
his opinion about the abuse of power and the corrupt elites that would kill mother and father for their own profit and the final victory of truth applies especially well to todays political and social context

american whats your power is it really money my brother says its money youve got lots of money  so what
truth is a real power whoever is right is strong you cheated on a man and took away his money did it make you stronger no it did not cause you are not right and the person you cheated on is that means hes stronger right
brother also drops lethal truths about women and their ways after spending all his roubles buying drinks and dope for a young interchangeable skank she tells danila

kate do you have condoms
danila why
kate why you really think i will give you back your money come here
two brothers for two majestic films 
the second volume simply titled brother  breaks the stereotype that sequels are always awful and is at least as good if not better than the original
same characters are followed but this time danilas brother in arms has been played by a crooked american businessman in touch with the muscovite mafia they attacked his brothers once more and he will have this time to cross the atlantic to reclaim what is rightfully his
again the movie is realistic gritty but has a lighter outlook on life whereas in the first volume the main character showed a sheer hatred for everything that came from america and corrupted his country the sequel that involves danilas adventures and clueless discovery of american culture often results in hilarious encounters
un film qui prend aux tripes 
if the red pill was a religion danila bagrov could be its patron saint you can watch it legally following this link which includes english subtitles the firm kinokompania stv that produced the film decided to release it online the film being such a household name in russia and worldwide
needless to say that you have watch it in the original russian the second opus can also be found online with english subtitles and russian audio
dont miss out on these monuments of russian cinema

"before trumps glorious victory over the forces of progressive darkness i promised that i would provide a roadmap on what traditional men could do next to usher in a return of the patriarchy if hillary had prevailed the roadmap would have been a grim one as all of our work would have had to take place underground happily we will be able to work in the open here are three ways that we can leverage trumps victory to bring back the patriarchy
rule yourself bruce wayne is a good role model for traditional men urbane fit financially independentand dangerous
this may seem obvious but if we are going to bring back the patriarchy we have to be men who are worthy of it a patriarch who relies solely on the fact that he is a man will quickly be overthrown however a man who has authority because he has earned it by the way he lives will naturally retain it thus the first step in making progress under a trump administration is the same as it would have been if hillary had been electedselfimprovement
selfimprovement involves the obvious things getting in shape training martial arts getting rid of addictions and exercising selfdiscipline the process of selfimprovement needs to be undergirded with a philosophy of life for most men this will involve adopting and faithfully living one of the faithtraditions for others it may mean adopting stoic philosophy whatever it is it will have to be more substantial than the degenerate pleasure wealth and power at any cost morality of our spirit cooking eliteslack of morality got us into this problem in the first place
selfimprovement also involves moving in the direction of financial independence under a trump administration this last goal will become easier to achieve trumps tax plan cuts tax rates across the board this will especially benefit men who are in the middle class who are trying to generate more income they will be able to keep their savings so that they can move ahead rather than paying a penalty that keeps them from becoming wealthy
trumps emphasis on fair trade will also result in more american jobs and unleash unprecedented creativity the age of trump will be a great time to start a new business one word of warning is in order though under trump the us is likely to flourish in a way that hasnt happened since the the s enjoy the prosperity but dont get caught back in the materialism merrygoround our goal is a lifetime of financial independence not conspicuous consumption
financial independence is an important practical consideration because you will need a firm financial foundation for the second step which is ruling your family
rule your family be the patriarch
starting with the boomers our society rejected the traditional way of life and adopted progressivism families got smaller divorce became more common promiscuity increased feminism became the default philosophy for girls and the remaining vestiges of the patriarchy vanished progressivism promised freedom but delivered enslavement to political correctness and globalism
a trump administration will do little to reverse the deleterious effects that progressivism has had on the family at best the only thing government can do for the family is encourage it financially and provide a safe environment for it but real change has to come from the bottom upfrom men and women who return to tradition for us that means finding a traditional woman or more likely one who can be converted to tradition getting married and having lots of children a twitter shitlord  johnrandom  drove home this point in a humorous way by suggesting with a fourstep trump bump starter kit




getting married having children and raising them to hold to the patriarchy is the long game but it is the only way we will have long term victory without a next generation of traditional men any ground that we gain under trump will soon be lost
rule societybring back the patriarchy benjamin franklin is a great example of a man who was serious about his civic duty
the next thing that we must do is start reclaiming our institutions trump has captured the presidency and republicans control congress but many of those republicans are cucks who will oppose the trumpian agenda and our other institutions are still dominated by leftists hollywood the news media education and corporations all proclaim the progressive antipatriarchy message if we dont take advantage of the current moment any gains that trump makes will be quickly rolledback after he leaves office
therefore we need to start reengaging with these institutions to shift them towards patriarchal nationalism  you can share any ideas you have to do this in the comments here id like to suggest that one institution that needs our participation the republican party trump has created many allies within the gop but the majority of the party still holds to the cucked ideology of open borders and bad trade deals like nafta the gop desperately needs likeminded men within its ranks who will help trump achieve his vision
getting involved in your local gop is easy you merely have to get in touch with your local party leadership in your district you dont have to run for elected office simply volunteer your time in getting local officials elected voting for delegates or attending gop events go in with a respectful attitude a lot of the local gop leaders are good people who still dont understand that the real battle is against globalists work for incremental change and if you have the disposition required for it consider running for local office yourself
one piece of advice if you do choose to get involved in politics dont get caught up in it one way we ended up with an ossified and outoftouch gop is that people started to hold the globalist neoconservatism with an almost religious fervor the other trap is to use politics as a way of enriching oneself in the manner of hillary clinton if you do choose to enter the political realm resolve at the outset to not use it for your own financial gain dont make politics your life think of it strictly as civic duty
of course politics is not everybodys cup of tea the key is to use your gifts whether that is in moviemaking or in running a company to help create an environment where the patriarchy can flourish
conclusion the one thing we must not do in wake of the trump victory is rest on our laurels if hillary had won wed all have a great sense of urgency to protect what little remained of our way of life now that trump is coming into power the temptation is to relaxto just let trump do it all this temptation must be avoided we must capitalize on the trump victory with the same high level of urgency that we would have regarded a hillary victory if we dont we run the risk of losing all the ground we have gained

"with the election over and done with america is turning its attention to the transition from president obama to president trump in barely two months the donald will take office ejecting the democrats coterie of corrupt courtiers and beginning his mission to right americas wrongs  but president trump cant do it alone he needs good talented people to work under him and carry out the hard work of making america great again
thats where you come in
the trump administration is now soliciting people to apply for jobs for when the man himself takes office in january we are officially calling on all ready and able return of kings readers to submit their applications and take up any job offers heres why you should consider a job in president trumps administration beyond obvious reasons such as money and prestige
 itll help keep president trump accountable 
while the media is lying about trump reneging on his campaign promises its still a good idea to give the man more reasons to keep his word by staffing his administration with committed nationalists well make it easier for president trump to fulfill his political program as well as make it more difficult for him to go back on his promises remember it was rankandfile fbi agents who forced james comey to reopen the investigation into hillary clinton  a leader needs loyal men in order to carry out his agenda
 youll be able to make history 
given the momentous task of rebuilding america after eight years of obamas perfidy and failure you almost have a civic duty to help president trump in his mission expecting america to become great again all on its own is delusional we need to do our part to restore this nations glory by working with the trump administration youll have a direct role in reshaping america for yearspossibly decadesto come
 youll help trigger the left 
despite their massive losses in the electionbeyond hillary clintons defeat the democrats now control only a handful of state governments and failed to dent the gops congressional majoritythe leftist mainstream media is trying to order trump around and persuade him to staff his administration with the same flacks who filled bushs and obamas right now theyre freaking out over breitbart executive chairman stephen bannon being appointed as trumps chief strategist 
by joining the trump administration youll have a hand in helping trigger the left into conniption fits and spasms of impotence nothing horrifies them more than losing access to the levers of power which theyve controlled for decades watching leftists squirm and cry is one of the biggest fringe benefits of trumps victory and we need to keep the triggering up for years to come
if you think you have the job skills return of kings highly recommends you apply for a job in trumps administration  president trump may have started the fire but its our job to help the fire rise

"over the last decades south korea has emerged as one of the wealthiest countries in all of asia currently the oecd country is roughly on the same material and economic level as other affluent east asian nations such as japan hong kong and taiwan however it appears now as perhaps the most potentially strong among them south korea seems more dynamic and willful than its larger neighbor and economic main rival japan which perhaps has entered the path of a more longterm decline
in this article i do briefly describe the main characteristics of contemporary south korea and also reflect upon various cultural subtopics which are of importance for any male who is interested in to obtain more sophisticated knowledge about nonwestern cultures and what they might and might not offer
the emergence of modern south korea culturally politically technologically and economically south korean development during the th century onward cannot be understood without to mention the strong ties to japan and the united states as much as japan suppressed korea between  the material progression is nevertheless a direct and indirect consequence of the traumatic colonial period korean leaders were also inspired by the japanese military dictatorship which in turn was influenced by european militarism after south koreawhich was formed in  after the divide of the countrystopped relying on american aid and focused on its own potential the economy grew rapidly due to an effective exportoriented industrialization
democracy was gradually introduced in  but some of these authoritarian residues are still visible in todays society the military in particular but also with regard to how many companies are run
presently the economicpolitical relationships between south korea and japan remain flexible and pragmatic for the sake of both countries the ties to the us seems less problematic although koreans negotiate between on one hand a more distinguished korean culture and on the other further western influences
additional ambivalence might also be a result of that some koreans regard american relations as a hinder in the process of a future reunification between the two korean nations generally though the political military and economic cooperation between south korea and the us appears fruitful and to the benefit of both sides
the korean wave and the rising appeal of south korea 
for quite a long time modern south korea may be regarded as not much more than a smaller version of japan although with a unique language and some other differentiating characteristics in postmillennial times however this picture has gradually shiftedboth among other asians westerners and people in other continents tootowards a more appealing national image
the reason for this is mainly material related to a refined development of technology samsung pop music kpop tv dramas kdrama cosmetic products kbeauty and perhaps also a more exciting metropolitan nightlife and a better ranked top university seoul national university the korean wave hallyu covers a whole plethora of different expressions of the rising popularity of south korean products and celebrities and it has had spillover effects for other sectors such as academia and tourism for instance more people are interested in learning korean than  or  years ago
the nightlife in the capital seoul is unhesitatingly of very high standard for instance this year dj mag ranks club octagon in gangnam as the fifth best night club in the entire world  in the city regions gangnam hongdae and itaewon in particular both foreigners and locals can easily find bars and clubs of various sizes that offer highquality entertainment and which conform to a relatively broad spectrum of tastes in music and dress style
cultural characteristics contempory south korean culture can be described as a hybrid of korean east asian and western culture as i have stated above south korea has been influenced by japan and the us in particular to a significant extent this means that the similar real or quasihierarchical structures as in for instance china and japan are visible in south korea too one is expected to speak and behave in different ways depending on a persons age or social rank which are more or less explicitly stated
this does largely overlap a meritocratic social structure rather than status being a primarily inherited factor a doctor is looked upon as socially more valuable than a regular office worker regardless of family background it is thus not much left of the old confucian system
the korean languageeven though about  of the words are based on chinese words and its grammar being partly similar to japaneseis unique with all its different suffixes that in turn conform to different speech and writing levels these can be more or less formal plain and polite but are always related to the social relations and contexts of either speaking or writing people who know each other well tend to use an intimate speech style haeche but in some contexts such as the workplace they might change to a more formal and polite level haeyoche when they walk to other people many who learn korean at a beginners level start with haeyoche and then gradually broaden the scope to include other levels of speaking and writing
apart from the korean language a foreigner may find many things in south korea that are either similar to places such as japan and hong kong or to the western world south korea especially seoul is largely the product of globalization and as a wealthy country this goes along with high standards of infrastructure and general quality of life as a hightech nation it appears as being in the forefront of material development often outshining its western counterparts at least in some ways
the present culture especially the more youthoriented culture is safe and relaxed only slight modifications in dress and behavior towards more politeness and moderation makes any westerner fit in well at least short termwise and to only speak english is seldom a real obstacle
if a person digs deeper into korean history and cultureand geographically move outside the seoul metropolitan areaone may find many differentiating and even somewhat unique characteristics although these do often have china as its root or point of departure but apart from buddhismwhich is separated rather than integrated into the larger societythese elements are seldom manifested in present time there are obviously many real buddhists and christians in present south korea but the traditional layers of culture tend to be mere relics of the past with that said the country as a whole is overall more socially conservative than many western counterparts

whether or not the trend towards increased westernization will continue remains an open question but in terms of technology and popular culture it is unlikely that south korea will look in other directions in the near future after all much of its present infrastructure and popular culture makes it into pretty much a local version of the westernglobal society
lastly two other things that have direct implications for any foreign person who reflects upon the option to stay longer in south korea than as a tourist temporary employee or exchange student is that  the population is very homogeneous and  it has no explicit will to change this fact
this means that it is difficult although not totally impossible to obtain a citizenship if you are not of korean descent south korea uses a type of partial jas sanguinis  citizenship by the blood it is not very uncommon these days that korean men get married to and have children with for instance southeast asian women such as filipinas and south korea is gradually shifting towards a more multiethnic society however compared to many western countries the levels of ethnic and genetic heterogeneity are much much smaller
due to the legal difficulties and cultural differences especially languagewise it is definitely not a smooth process to become naturalized as a korean citizen or resident permanent and temporary living are generally two very different things and south korea is yet another palpable manifestation of that
women in south korea phenotypically south korean women are similar to those of other east asian populations as a result of drastically improved nutrition younger south koreans are relatively tall seemingly not much shorter on average than their western counterparts the levels of obesity are slightly rising but still very low compared to the us canada and even thinner european countries such as italy and sweden overall korean femalesespecially girlscan be characterized as moderately tall and slim
additionally a significant share cares a lot about their appearances fashion diet hair style and makeup are all very important in everyday life and although these things change rapidly due to new trends and seasonal shifts many will ride along the same wave wherever it goes collectivism is quite striking in that respect and subcultures are not as widespread and visible as in japan many look about the same
as with many phenomena in life the extent to which a person likes or dislikes how a population generally appears is related to individual taste with that said i think that more objectively speaking the two main strengths of korean girls and younger women are that they are relatively thin and wellgroomed they do everything they can to optimize their beauty potentials sometimes even with the help of plastic surgery which will make them look somewhat more european which partly is an ideal among east asian populations

additionallyeven if this stems more from observations and anecdotes than general factsthey tend to be more polite and welleducated in a positive sense than western females this is something they also have in common with other well off asians such as japanese taiwanese and singaporeans in the more exciting locations of seoul one will find quite many pretty and decent korean girls and even though hookup culture has for good and for bad penetrated the south of the korean peninsula a significant share of these females may be looked upon as serious girlfriend material
western guys do have a comparative advantage in terms of looks and even sometimes behavior korean guys tend to lack the cockiness of westerners but these automatic benefits should not be overemphasized many of the things that girls are attracted to such as confidence extroversion and good looks are general close to universal traits if one is a loser in the west then one will probably be that in the east as well conversely the more alpha males will magnify their results if they have the proper time and opportunity to do so
conclusion overall south korea is a rather impressive modern society that shares many of the good features with its equally rich neighbors however recently it has seemingly surpassed places like japan and hong kong in terms of material development nightlife and popular culture for some western males between the ages of  south korea might offer a valuable opportunity for temporaryranging from weeks to even years and circular migration because eventually it is most likely time to go home regardless if one wishes it or not

and here the following question arises what defines us liberals have been shrieking about xenophobia or racism all the time yet strictly national boundaries are much less relevant than before even for us  even when we all rejoiced about trumps promise to make a wall all over the world we are rejoicing around the gop candidates victory 
american trumpists undoubtedly feel closer to nonamericans who have been dissenting from the nwo on the internet and wanted the donald to pass than to american libtards a lot of us are ok with having nonwhites around we dont pander to arrogant aggressive antiwhites but that does not mean we would have to be racists as the liberal caricature wants us to be to cut in more personally i know of no genuine redpilled or altrighter who would have rejected me as a frog although i remember some stars and stripes cucks blaming me for daring to speak about american politics without owning a us passport the frog is green after all 
so once again what defines us why are we a we race plays a role for sure we struggle to keep the white people from getting dissolved into the acid bath of widescale miscegenation and dispossession we want a right to solidarity based at least partly on race ie on lineage and identity just like all the pseudominority groups out there we fight the double standard that allows them to be communitarian tribalistic nepotistic without being ever responsible of what they do whereas we are supposed to keep our heads down and be taught everything by liberal social engineers in a world where we would have no freedom no future no dignity 
but even then there have been blacks latinos  and many women who participated into bringing the donald to the white house i have a racemixed friend who supported trump all along this is not to say im not a racist afraid cuckservativestyle but to show there are some and we know it firsthand 
it is no mystery why most of us are white we are united around a civilization that was primarily built by people of european descent but there is more too 
and this more that i think defines and binds us this more is shared awareness  on the periphery of the system centers we managed to grow and gather 
we are all aware broadly speaking of the same phenomena and trends we have witnessed the breakup of families and harmonious relationships between men and women we have been faced with the untold prohibition to make the least critic of feminism minority groups aggressive identitarianism and with the pervasive omnipresence of these leftist norms commonly referred to as political correctness we have seen neoliberalism allowing a handful of careless irresponsible assholes sending the jobs overseas importing thirdworld immigration then force us into a life of chronic unemployment or endless struggles against other lowwage individuals for a small place under the sun 
we saw how conservatism was a sham that never faced the genuine problems we witnessed societies crumble conflictual minoritarian group identities being crafted by the likes of soros and the meritorious worker or professionalwhatever his racegetting exploited to the benefit of the lower and upper parasites we saw the liberal establishment using various social categories like pawns to create horizontal struggles and depopulation  
of course some disagreements can be found on this or that particular issue but we all see the same devastated landscape in lieu of the brilliant civilization the west once was 
and here is the major fault line the leftists deny or value they often go from the former to the latterthe replacement of native european population the aggressive and tribalistic stance of minority groups towards the silent majority the forced inclusion of individuals into sick identity politics games the perpetual hostility and institutionalized prejudice against whites and males either the leftists utterly deny what we are aware of for example when they say that whites are not under replacement or they demonize it as a remnant of some privilege or prejudice 
all their talk about oppressed minorities dissimulates the very real disenfranchisement of the white majority of nonwhite meritorious and integrated westerners and serves to deny us from our rights to public empathy to dignity or to even basically survive in a world of our own they work on language and representations because their job consists in manipulating these thus brainwashing us into seeing the world through their lenses and denying the legitimacy of any other vision 
the importance of shared awareness explains why we united on the internet a lot of us were closet nationalists years ago and still are we could not and often still cannot be nationalists in public or we would have been excluded from normal social life by the local leftists and cowards leftist hegemony was and is still real in the mainstream you know hegemony when you see it and spend countless hours thinking about how you can thrive even when living under it 
in the mid i found out about the information website fdesouche native french quote by the standards of today this news aggregator seems hardly interesting it mostly collates pieces written by others but then it was fantastic here i could recognize what i already felt about the worldthat something was wrong with all these nonwhites thugs holding the streets and getting lavish promotion when they bragged about it it was all concentrated before my eyes and others were talking about what they went through daily as well at least others felt and saw the same as i did i was not crazy not bound to a life of unauthenticity or forlorn solitude among the almighty left we were assembling and we were on the internet fdesouchecomthe website they want to keep you from visiting 
as most of us found ourselves under attack from nonnative frenchmen and knowing intuitively that identity goes deeper than the fleeting winds today called culture we often despised immigration in general but eventually things changed thanks to alain soral  mostly who emphasized how racial struggle was leading to sterile battles among disenfranchised people while letting the truly powerful off the hook mathias cardet a black journalist who worked with soral showed how gangstarap culture was injected and nurtured among nonwhites by powerful interests 
after all one can be black or arab and wanting to live in peace as a free individual not as an identity politics pawn who spends his life attacking another social category 
being prowhite promasculinity and protradition does not require being white i often felt closer from muslims with good intentions ie muslims who were genuine believers and not rancorous people using islam as a mask for antiwhite tribalism than from white liberals the muslims would not share my blood but they would share some of my awareness and yearning for tradition two things that white liberals eagerly reject faith front warriors alliance against common foes 
the internet is immaterial it is basically a network where information flows awareness and the will to spread it are immaterial as well this is why we could meet and act on the internet after all the alt right and manosphere have been sharing ideas media contents memes advisesand only later proceeded to meetups panicking the totalitarian liberals in the process 
trumps victory is a major one regardless of what the donald will actually do it is an event of considerable historical magnitude but it is only the beginningmake no mistake about that the libtards establishment still holds loads of money of institutions of cultural territory it has started to crumble and leak  yet it is still there 
major battles are waiting ahead we have to further our awareness make thorough research on every aspect of leftism and develop more proper cultural references 
always remember the libtards never cared one second about us they would have let us die off alone poor childless traumatized and demonized had we not chosen to follow the path of the red pill 
america is a firsttier power but it is still a battlefield among others wherever we are it is time to thicken our mutual relationships and cooperate more closely it is a battle not between nationals and foreigners but between workers and parasites between those who feel the void and wrongness in the rotten core of postmodernity and those who dwell in the last liberal trend between the realists who want freedom and responsibility in a healthy world of values and cultures against those who ravel in blue pill media bullshit complacency parasitism and cucking for the empire of nothing 
we are the future it doesnt matter where we are we are those with true awareness those with genuine and healthy values those who struggled to hone their abilities and most importantly those who actually deserve to inherit the western world so save it and conquer it country after country institution after institution outlet after outletor there will be nothing left",Fake
"suppose you are one of those adventurous americans who meets and marries a beautiful foreign woman you are the envy of all your friends what next
you can bring her back home to the united states or europe the guys will be jealous the women will feel threatened and your bride will be a fish out of waterfor a while but it doesnt take them long to get established she will find a group of her countrywomen other thais vietnamese or ukrainians they will teach her the ropes where to go shopping for the kind of groceries she needs the most efficient way to send money to her relatives back home where her fellow countrymen hang out and oh yes they will also learn american culture their friends will explain about american men and american divorce law and that is where the trouble starts
my vietnamese war bride an upscale frenchified thing informed me after just over a year of marriage after i had helped her family escape saigon that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle when the inevitable the divorce came she refused a reasonable settlement offer and hired a junkyard dog lawyer to fight it in court losing she was shocked to discover that that offer was off the table
keep your woman in her own country where she is comfortable and where the culture is more likely to appreciate men you make the adjustment to her culture instead of vice versa why american culture is about the most poisonous in the world almost anything is better countries that havent been indoctrinated in feminism and cultural marxism still value children and respect a womans role in bearing them and raising them they also respect a mans role as the breadwinner and head of the family
i committed myself to ukraine nine years ago met my wife seven years ago and our son appeared five years ago it is worth enumerating the many ways in which it is a pleasure to be living with her and raising him in kyiv instead of the usa
 kyiv is a beautiful and lively city beautiful architecture  andreevska church
kyiv is a worthy capital city it has millenniumlong history studded with cathedrals and other exquisitely crafted monuments there are many many targets for a tourist camera the walled city was built to be defensible situated atop a steep bluff on the right bank of the dnieper river close to where the desno river joins from the east  miles south of where another major tributary the pripyat flows in from the west from their capital in kyiv the viking princes could easily sally out in their long boats to the black sea or anywhere in western russia
the sandy river beaches are good for swimming from june to september and for fishing any time it isnt frozen one can rent kayaks and rowboats or take a river cruise in the warmer months when it does freeze it is dotted with ice fishermen all it takes is a saw some bait a line and the antifreeze of ones choice there are bicycle paths along the river and on the islands in the middle of the river the city is experiencing a surge in the number of bicycle commuters
the soviet system had its good points they housed everybody in highrise apartments it may not be as attractive as detached houses but it makes for a very compact city those people needed places to breathe and exercise so the city is full of parks as compact as kyiv is it is with most people living in apartment blocks it easy to get around every place in the city is within walking distance of a convenience store of some sort and restaurants and shopping centers are usually within a walk or a short bus ride
young people the world over want to live in the city and kyiv is no exception it has lots of bars cafÃ©s and nightclubs the trends are toward sushi and italian food ukraine is traditional enough that young people even go to church there are orthodox churches in every neighborhood and a handful of englishspeaking congregations scattered throughout the city
kyiv is home to ukraines most famous universities shevchenko university kyivmohyla academy and kyiv polytechnic institute these are their harvard yale and mit  an extraordinarily high percentage of business and government leaders have graduated from them they know each other as in the united states just being admitted to these universities is a sign of intelligence and talent for a foreigner getting to know these elites is a lot easier than getting to know ivy leaguers in the united states
 ukraine is extremely affordable attractive inexpensive traditional markets and supermarkets of course
kyiv is a very inexpensive place to live very bottom of the big mac index the hryvnya exchange rate has fallen threefold since the start of the war in donbass prices have risen especially for imports but not nearly as much the tourist will note that it is still possible to get a decent hotel room for  a taxi anywhere in the city for  and a meal for under  that is just the start
for those of us who live here  metro ridesbuses and trams are even lessmake life cheap and convenient try the grocery store a pound for potatoes beets carrots onions and cabbage the staples of the ukrainian diet meat is generally under two dollars a pound although there is a lot of hue and cry about corruption in the energy business in the end it costs far less than in the united states  a month to heat a house and between four and five dollars a gallon for gasoline however most ukrainians utilities are included in rent and only a few drive cars
medical care is a preview of the impending obamacare disaster the state promises the moon but delivers only what it can afford the average ukrainian has to stand in a long line to get indifferent service from underequipped and underpaid doctors in shabby soviet era hospitals the flip side is that feeforservice is alive and well you can get decent care if you pay for it and it doesnt cost very much in fact ukraine is a medical tourism destination especially for fertility treatments plastic surgery and dental work
an american social security check makes you rich by local standards it is a good place to live in retirement moreover any american can teach english and there are a number of entrepreneurial opportunities that dont take a lot of capital to start
 ukrainians are fairly uniformly slavic  and they like people like themselves just us slavs
western newspapers are full of horror stories about ukraine  war and corruption leaders in moscow washington and europe love to point fingers at us to distract from the increasingly blatant corruption surrounding those in the west im no fan of corruption but given the fact that it is universal it is worth relating why ukrainian corruption is more comfortable to live with than that of the europe or the united states
there is no hypocrisy about our corruption or rather the hypocrisy is so transparent that nobody believes the lies the virtue we still have free speech ukrainians do not lose their jobs if they are politically incorrect they are not jailed if they say what they think about middle eastern immigration if you tell a woman she looks good she might actually blush and appreciate it
the corruption has kept the standard of living low which perversely has important benefits people remain traditional because they have needed the support of families just to survive asylum seeking immigrants dont come because there is nothing here for themfew jobs and nothing in the way of welfare
not having immigrants leads to high levels of social capital the people actually like and trust each other i am the only american in our little development of  homes they have included me in the groupeverybody knows me and says hello when i meet them on the street in the bus and in the stores in my toney neighborhood of bethesda maryland most neighbors were too occupied with their important jobs to bother being neighborly
the fact that it is mostly just slavs has a couple of important corollaries there are no bad neighborhoods in kyiv people will tell you to avoid the troyeshchena but a lot of people i know live there i went to see for myself i had a couple of pleasant shots of vodka chatting with the locals i cannot imagine doing that in the anacostia neighborhood of washington dc
people always stand up to give my son and me a seat on the bus or metro old ladies absolutely gush over him and engage him in small talk they support their rising generation and are tickled to death that i am raising him to be a ukrainian
lastly even though the locals will tell you otherwise ukrainians are good and polite drivers they invariably stop for you at crosswalks very few will drive after even one drink fatalities per vehicle mile are about twice as high as in the west because the roads are poor but you cant blame it on the drivers
 young people have pride in themselves an english language toastmasters meeting
students and young professionals show selfrestraint no tattoos no piercings no sloppy clothes no swearing very little smoking and no drugs they are what in the s was called squaredelightfully so they look forward to marriage and families especially the women for this reason they are perhaps not as easy as girls elsewhere but when you get one you have something of substance
there are lots of places to meet young people needless to say bars and nightclubs there are studios all over town giving inexpensive dance lessonssalsa and swing are bigand hundreds of sports clubs the english language mafia club is thriving the toastmasters public speaking club attracts many of the best and brightest with meetings in english german russian and ukrainian the language exchange club also meets in several languages from may to september the river beaches are great surrounded by restaurants bars and discos
ukrainians love to practice their english and welcome foreigners not too many make it this far east it is an easy place to make friends
 it is a good place to sit out the wests coming civil unrest one of kyivs many lovely river beaches
the western press would have you believe that kyiv is a lawless wild west that is the opposite from the truth  even today it is safer than any western capital city
the first danger cited is vladimir putin when are the russians going to invade answer they wont throughout is history russia has expanded by stealth and opportunity they stopped when finland fought back in  and georgia fought back in  they swiped the baltics and part of poland only after germany had started a war that diverted the worlds attention they imposed their will on their european satellites only because the red army conveniently occupied them at the end of world war ii
in ukraine they took the opportunity of political chaos in  to steal crimea where by treaty they already had a large military presence emboldened they thought they had an opportunity in the russianspeaking donbass but the ukrainians resisted and that war is at a standstill putin knows full well that  million ethnic russians cannot dominate  million ethnic ukrainians especially under the glare of world opinion despite what the neocons may have shouted to sway the us election the russians are not coming another comforting thought is that there is nothing here worth nuking it is a benefit of staying out of nato
there is no dependent class here to rise up when economic hardship hits hardship is already here there are no discontented minorities gypsies the most visible of them actually workthey sell flowers and work as junk dealers you cannot be a parasite if there is no blood to suck it is the united states and europe that have legions of restless unemployed who are only being pacified by government benefits and will rise up when governments can no longer afford them
ukraines corruption is well understood by everybody as much as they complain people know how to cope with it it may take bribery to get things done but they generally do get done corruption does not result in much violence occasionally some hardnosed judge or a pesky reporter gets bumped off true but in every case the victim could have explained quite clearly why he was targeted it is not like the random killing of whites by blacks in the united states or random islamic terror in western europe
ukraine has lots of land excellent agriculture abundant water reasonably good natural resources and a homogeneous and hardworking population it is not as dependent on international trade as most european countries when the world financial system collapses ukraine will come through looking pretty good they are so far down that it all looks like up and the stress lines for civil unrest simply dont exist though you may come here for the love of a wonderful woman you will find it a delightful place to make your home

"with her hollywood and silver screen career options all but dried up former charmed actress and constantly nearnaked attentionseeker rose mcgowan is now a leading feminist as you would expect this transition occurred after her looks which never approached those of costar alyssa milano had well and truly begun to fade mcgowan is not alone in making this spectacular shift pamela anderson and professional sjw natasha devon are among a growing crowd of women who rail against sexism and objectification after years of trying often very successfully to sexualize their youth
seeking to cash in on her newfound fame as an unhinged sjw rose mcgowan launched the rose army a kind of personal cult that tries to hide the overt narcissism of its creator by supporting campaigns against domestic violence and female objectification full sjw mode is just a button away for her for instance she attacked gays for not being feminist enough and probably projecting her jealousy over not landing a significant acting role for an eternity claimed an xmen movie poster promoted violence against women 
so now comes the task of reconciling the new rose mcgowan with the old one whose selfobjectification is best described by this infamous photo with exboyfriend marilyn manson

excuses excuses rose mcgowan has tried to gloss over her past history of selfobjectification and sexualization by saying she was merely a pawn of the patriarchy
mcgowan is now even blaming her past personal feuds such as with a fellow charmed actress shannen doherty on patriarchy sexism and female objectification  sadly this very public attentionseeking in which mcgowan wrote doherty an open letter comes at the same time that the latter is suffering from cancer  but you know a girls gotta attentionwhore including when another girl she used to have catfights with is about to die
rose mcgowan has a lot in common with pamela anderson ex playboy cover model anderson after an entire career made from taking her clothes off and otherwise selling her body as if she were competing for a championship has now come out against pornography  she may not be bad for a gal nearing  but her best years are a good  years behind her i would wager that pamela anderson hit  and spent the last several years in denial before she decided to lambaste an industry currently lauding nubile girls in their twenties and not her pornography addictions are bad but anderson showing these new colors in  is nothing short of a joke
andersons position can be summed up by the following two pictures
time when she did not condemn pornography 

time when she condemns pornography 

previously a lot of attention has been paid to fat or unattractive girls being feminists these activists are nominally against the sexualization of women but appear to be driven primarily by envy and the need to diminish societys praise of attractive females whilst there is a lot of truth to this it only tells part of the story the rank opportunism of feminism is perhaps better explained by women who once made a career from selling their appearances and have subsequently turned on the industries whose financial teats they used to suckle and what better time to turn on these industries whether they be the pornography film or modeling markets than when your looks no longer allow you to actively participate in them
this phenomenon runs parallel to female athletes both utilizing and complaining about their sexualization  attractive tennis players like sabine lisicki and unattractive ones like serena williams have made careers out of wearing revealing oncourt clothing which is much more for show than practicality but when the chance presents itself lisicki and others have moaned like at this years wimbledon  about how manufacturers designs make them show too much skin many of these girls may not have lost their attractiveness yet but they pick and choose when objectification is bad just like celebrities whose looks have abandoned them
its not just famous people natasha devon
many return of kings readers will remember natasha devon from her awful performance against milo yiannopoulos during a british sky news debate on fashion mannequins there seems to have been an eerie timing in devons transition from selfdescribed former model to sjw she founded a socalled body image education program in  in her midtwenties i dont know about you but this seems to be the sort of age when nonfamous models in particular face the meat grinder due to competition from younger fresher girls
as she hurtled towards  natasha devon penned an article for cosmopolitan magazine on bulimia which morphed into a regular monthly column then came the selfesteem team devon created in  frequently with government funding the selfesteem team has essentially applauded obesity britains number one health crisis and sought to reengineer what humans are programmed by evolution to find attractive
devon along with anderson and mcgowan may chalk an antiobjectification epiphany down to age experience or something similarly convenient but the changes happened neither at the height of their selfsexualization careers nor during the prewall protracted slide always be on the look out for when exactly a woman took up feminist or general sjw activism
when a woman complains about the objectification of women it usually means a she never had the goods to begin with b her goods werent enough to compete with other girls or c her goods are well and truly gone there is a delicious irony to option c as countless women will milk their looks until natureor a halfdecade of alcohol or drugfueled benderstakes them away
feminism as projection 
it is par for the course in todays political climate that our enemies describe us as sad mommas boys who play out failed encounters with women through our beliefs of anyone roosh has faced this entirely baseless criticism the most all because our opponents have been unable to actually refute what he and return of kings say
we need to turn this idea of projection against feminists even more than we have before modernday feminism is itself the domain of women seeking easy comforts from an ideology that explains away either their own faults or their most primal fears about a harsh uncertain world for women whose looks are now washedup feminism enables them to label objectification as wrong and soothe the crushing blows that come from no longer getting the attention they were used to
rather than seeing these women as twisted and evil it is better to perceive the behavior for what it is desperation and the shocking realization that they are sexually irrelevant

"every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women 
the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw 
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump
donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it
approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug

from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space
human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing

now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness
conclusion we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes
im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next

"were all about selfimprovement here at return of kings a man should always be seeking to improve himself in some fashion and when he has achieved one goal he should move onto the next one in short never rest on your laurels
combining this desire for self improvement with the masculine independence and minimalist lifestyle that other writers on this fine website should inculcate in you a desire to improve yourself while being thrifty and relatively solitary as this article deals with fitness you know what im going to say personal trainers or at the very least the ones at your average commercial gym should be avoided at all costs and while most longterm fitness enthusiasts and professionals will likely either train by themselves or have one of the few trainers that knows what hes doing most of us have to train alone especially beginners who have naught but common sense to light his path but there is another option books 

yes books that simple yet elegant method of transferring knowledge directly to its viewer there are certainly plenty of books out there pertaining to the various fields of fitness and athletics but the question remains how effective is a book in physical training
as an avid reader of fitnessrelated tomes and many others but thats neither here nor there i own many of these books and i feel that their effectiveness can be judged by grouping them based on genre
weight lifting and calisthenics when i first started getting into physical culture as a young teenager i turned to the nearby commercial gym as most tyros tend to in that commercial gym i quickly found myself being attached to a wellmeaning jackass who gave me a machineheavy program that according to him would develop strength size and endurance and like most naive young men i followed him developing none of those things but lining the trainers pockets
eventually realizing that i had been lied to i embarked on a search for enlightenment coming to the various corners of the internet that deal in such interests one of the first things that i came across were books that i have repeatedly referred to in these pages and still consider to be some of the best writing on general fitness out therethe works of men such as paul wade and pavel tsatsouline upon reading books such as power to the people and the convict condidtioning series and using a bit of common sense i deduced that these books were superior than the typical tomes on fitness that the commercial gyms would sell at the counter for a few reasons
one they advocated a physical philosophy of simplicity and purity rather than advocating a julienne of exercises their routines were efficient and targeted all muscles of the body two the credentials of the men were a cut above the average writer as a maximum security convict and a spetsnaz veteran respectively i knew that these men needed to train their muscles to fighting trim for purposes of survival rather than doing curls for the girls and third they referred to the strongmen of old like maxick and eugen sandow standing on the shoulders of giants and opening my eyes to the wider world of fitness writing much of which i have further consumed
in general i would argue that writing on weightlifting and calisthenics are the most effective books on fitness as these are solitary activities and the books are typically written by one man speaking to another man thus the techniques there in are written to be easily understood and practiced by the user without a partner

martial arts as i have repeatedly stated on this website  martial arts in general should be taken with a massive grain of saltwhile im not so stupid as to say theres no point in training any sort of refined fighting style because of adrenaline and yes i have seen this boneheaded argument made i have also spent a substantial amount of time debunking the overly flowery and outright fictitious martial arts styles that many hack authors and filmmakers propagate on my own website as well as my youtube and dailymotion channels sadly thanks to martial arts being more or less an unregulated market in the united states any clown has the full legal right to proclaim himself a master
with that being said some martial arts books are effective thoroughly explaining the proper mechanics of a move andor explaining proper situations in how to use them while i have a background in proper study i have also utilized books to teach aspects of martial arts that i was not formally taughtsuch as grappling and again i sought out accomplished and legitimate fighters that were decorated in their field men like farmer burns  lessons in catch wrestling and physical culture  and masao takahashi  mastering judo  wrote detailed and efficient books for fighting in the clinch and i have also used dr sang kims books on taekwondo such as complete kicking for learning some of the more exotic kicks that my own background didnt teach me and of course i practiced on resisting opponents some of whom had been wrestlers themselves and thus could shore up my technique
the most important thing to bear in mind when using a martial arts book is that you must practice these techniques against a bagdummy at the very least and preferably with a sparring partner that will put up a fight and while this is also the case for any book on physical culture i would argue that its the most important for martial artsnamely because martial arts techniques are by definition used in panic situations in contrast weightlifting is almost always done in a state of relative calmnessnot counting the fake screaming idiots use to pump themselves up

mindsetmeditationetc books such as the kundalini meditation manual by yogi bhajan which i have only recently started to use are simultaneously the most simple and most complicated books on selfimprovement to use they are simple because in very basic terms the advice they give is basically think really hard about something but it is precisely that abstractness that can make them difficultmeditation is a nebulous concept for the best of us to grasp immediately and in some ways changing ones mindset and behavior is the most difficult thing anybody can do
while i admittedly do not have the depth of knowledge in these that i do with the other two topics i would say that these are hard to grasp but easy to practice once they have been grokked in the words of anthony burgess after all every second of every day of your life will involve you utilizing your mindset and thus its difficulty lies in the original understanding

conclusion looking at these three broad genres of male selfimprovement books we can see that they differ greatly in content but speaking from a position of experience i can safely say that to a great extent they are effective and they can teach you new things but only if you get one of the relatively few books that arent written by armchair alpha males and only if you diligently practice the information contained within them

"why you should become a minimalist why you should become a minimalist february    comments lifestyle 
the most abused word in the english language is need if youre reading this post i contend there is little that you actually need beyond what you currently possess you have ample electricity to power your computer in a climatecontrolled environment with running water and food in your wellstocked refrigerator why then do you always hear people talking about how they need more stuff 
humans have a deeplyrooted drive to compete with each other and advertisers capitalize on this impulse take a moment to picture the average person that you meet what do they have to take pride in buying the newest thing allows them to join the club of consumers and for a fleeting moment to be measured on an equal playing field despite their personal shortcomings the internal pain of their lifes problems dissipates for the split second they can boast superiority over everyone who doesnt have the same shiny widget 
this conspicuous consumption creates a selffulfilling egoinvestment in the broken system although borrowing money for useless luxury purchases subjugates people into debt slavery the mentality is if i paid  for this hunk of metal and im working overtime to pay it off it must be worth it  and so are other things that the commercials are telling me to buy quite literally we are working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we dont need  
if youre reading this blog you are likely a male aged  who wants to do one or more of the following quit your job travel explore a locationindependent income get yourself in shape take charge of a relationship and learn valuable life skills a minimalist mentality helps you do all of these things 
having fewer possessions forces you to properly place a higher value on experiences this will make it safer and more fulfilling to travel because you are in touch with what truly makes you happy if youre working on a side hustle or starting a business the desire for needless possessions drains your disposable income levels and prevents you from taking risks if my business fails will i have to give up my car lease preempt this loss aversion by having less to lose 
if you want to move to a better city with a higher cost of living having excess stuff sets a floor on how much rent youll pay to house your crap and in turn how much you can spend on leisure activities if youre a distractable person like me removing visual noise from your area makes you more likely to create things with your mind and less likely to fixate on your environment  
throwing or giving useless things away is a good first step since possessions have a psychic weight that you may not realize until you rid yourself of them to fully embrace this mindset you must also kill the desires that have been inculcated in you since birth cut down on your consumer impressions by watching less tv and trying to rationally dissect the techniques used in the few advertisements you encounter find fulfillment in hobbies and work rather than chasing the rush and eventual hedonic adaptation from consuming much like a drug successive bouts of consumerism create a higher baseline where your overall happiness is no different but you end up having a bunch of useless crap that ties you down 
girls can also be troublesome in this endeavor ever notice that when a girl spends extended time in your living space she beings to tell you that you need a new this or a replacement that a good friend once told me all human beings have an innate desire to create  most women cant so they redecorate limit your exposure to women who attempt to thwart a separation from consumerism ironically men likely to lead a minimalistnomadic lifestyle are simply more attractive to primesmv women think about whether the starving artist or the bottle service guy throwing money around ends up getting more ass as always watch how women behave rather than listening to what they say when they are protesting your lifestyle change 
ask yourself this if your house burned down and you had nothing but the clothes on your back what would you be worth to society and to yourself how would you feel about losing all of the possessions you own most people plugged into the matrix would rather die than think about replacing aunt gladyss vase or baby pictures they havent looked at in a decade this is an illusion once you begin to divorce yourself from this emotional investment to stuff you will implicitly place more value on your skills and past experiences 
minimalism is not a synonym for frugality or cheapness i dont wear a potato sack while pedaling a used tricycle to work every day  i simply choose to allocate my money to experiences and a few possessions that will fulfill me and advance my lifes purpose rather than enslave myself into debt for trinkets that will collect dust somewhere 
taking the red pill is about learning to separate your priorities and desires from those that society forces upon you i dont promise that adopting this mindset will make everybody happy but it will certainly help to clarify what contributes to your individual sense of self and will allow you to focus on the internal and external traits that exemplify a man of value",Fake
"by now everyone has been reminded that the media is not infallible it is composed of very fallible human beings who make mistakes with the same regularity as all the rest of us i was recently reading a bit about something in statistics called galtons problem an observational dynamic named after its discoverer sir francis galton
to state it very crudely galtons problem is a situation resulting when observers assume that certain things are separate and discrete when in fact they are not for example those who failed to predict donald trumps electoral victory assumed that social conditions in the united states were isolated from those of the rest of the world such people failed to notice the evidence of widespread public anger in many other countries most notably england italy france and hungary
sir francis galton
failure to take into consideration the big picture is still forgivable of course no one can be right all the time or even most of the time systems in the modern world suffer from too much input and data rather than too little but deliberate lying is quite another matter and it is undeniable that some mainstream media outlets have deliberately sought to conceal the truth on a variety of domestic and foreign issues rather than act as a check on governmental power the media has actually become an arm of government power enforcing doctrinal orthodoxy with a variety of carrots and sticks that have proven to be reasonably effective

individual journalists can play significant roles in this process consider a favorite example of mine the case of famed baseball player ty cobb ive been an admirer of cobb for a very long time ever since reading his autobiography as a boy something never quite felt true about all those stories that other biographers would tell about him the worst of these was sports writer al stump whose biography of cobb has now been discredited as mostly fabrication
stump was granted exclusive access to ty cobb in  and  for his biographical purposes cobb shared with him many intimate details of his life and career but instead of faithfully reproducing those recollections stump embellished slanted and outright fabricated numerous anecdotes designed to cast cobb in the worst possible light stump portrayed cobb as a southern racist cobb was from georgia a misogynist and even a murderer cobb was not alive at the time all these stories began to circulate and was unable to defend himself
to add insult to injury stumps writings were used as the basis for a terrible  film called cobb which starred tommy lee jones the film is a tissue of lies and distortions that deserved toand didflop at the box office the real ty cobb was a complex driven and highly intelligent figure who knew how to court controversy when he had to but was actually a gentleman by the standards of the era readers interested in further reading should consult the wonderful biography by charles leerhsen entitled ty cobb a terrible beauty 
a famous photo of cobb stealing third base
to begin with cobb used brains rather than brawn to beat his opponents he made careful studies of all the top players of his day and crafted strategies designed to exploit their weaknesses for example when he learned that pitcher walter johnson hated hitting batters with pitches cobb would crowd the plate to force johnson to walk him he learned how to get inside the heads of his adversaries forcing them to lose their tempers when they did cobb would steal bases right under their noses he remains one of the few players in history who knew how to steal home base

one legend about cobb that has persisted is that he was a violent brawler this is simply not true it is true that men of his era got into fistfights oftenit was part of a healthy masculine culture back thenbut he never gratuitously assaulted or struck anyone the few incidents that have been held out as examples of his misbehavior eg a fight with a black groundskeeper and assorted hotel brawls prove to be on closer inspection nothing more than the standard types of fights that physicallyminded men like him became entangled with nearly all ballplayers of his era engaged in them including babe ruth
al stumps character assassination of cobb went even further painting him as an unreconstructed southern racist who had a grudge against blacks this is completely false cobb was actually one of the few early supporters of integration in the big leagues when asked his opinion about subject by the sporting news in  he said the negro has the right to compete in sports and who is to say he has not
he had nothing but compliments for black athletes like willie mays and jackie robinson and players in the negro league whom cobb interacted with in the s confirm that there was no trace of prejudice in cobbs makeup cobb mentored younger players corresponded with fans with personalized letters and helped found a hospital and a college education fund
cobb was certainly no angel but in hindsight he was nothing more than an aggressive daring man who played professional sports at a time when things were much less regulated than they are now cobb himself may even have allowed spurious tales about himself to circulate in order to court publicity but he had a limit and complete fairy tales he would not tolerate
stumps lies have been so pervasive and persistent that the mythology surrounding cobb will take decades to undo if anything cobb was too trusting in letting a man like stump into his confidence cobb was so angry with stumps hatchet job that he was preparing to sue to prevent publication of stumps writings in  just before his death the terrible  film cobb only added more oil to the fire
malicious journalism can do serious damage sometimes the damage comes from ignorance other times from deliberate peddling of falsehood the motives for lyingwhether coming from money fame or the desire to virtue signalcan always be found if one digs below the surface in the modern era the default rule must be to seek independent confirmation of news stories and to remember that journalists are subject to the same human emotions and weaknesses as all the rest of us

"the media is beginning to demonize the manosphere and alt right twitter has suspended multiple accounts such as milo yiannopoulos ricky vaughn and matt forney the guardian wrote a hit piece against the red pill  the media has called altright groups xenophobic racist and misogynist despite not pointing to a single piece of evidence
as antitrump rallies continue to rage across the nation in new york city philadelphia and michigan the media completely ignores all of the assaults occurring on trump voters

despite the elites attempts to destroy us we are in fact winning this battle the reasons why are simple
truth is always more powerful than falsehood we are too numerous to be effectively silenced we dont congregate on one single platform were a collection of individuals based around an ideology were high energy decisive assertive and confident men below i would like to offer the supporters of our causes some signs of hope victory is near and trump is going to lead the way
 george soros being sued for  million 
according to breitbart  along with dozens of other alternative news sites dallas police department sergeant demetrick pennie president of the dallas fallen officer foundation is suing a multitude of individuals for inciting a race war
george soros hillary clinton jesse jackson barrack obama the new black panthers and more some individuals might claim that theres no way someone can take on this collection of massively powerful and wealthy elites in a single lawsuit and they may be right however whether or not this lawsuit is successful is completely irrelevant
what matters far more is that the word is starting to get out there the president of the dallas fallen officer foundation an extremely reputable organization is taking steps to file a massive lawsuit against these individuals this will at the very least do several things
potentially serve a massive blow to the globalists show the elites that we will not back down generate huge amounts of public awareness show the average gun rights promoting masculine traditional american that they have our support and best of all the lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of texas which means that the outcome will generally be good either way
first of all theres a very high likelihood of them winning due to the case being handled in texas a highly conservative state second in the event that the case doesnt win it will likely be pursued all the way to the supreme court if this occurs expect truly amazing things to happen the reason why the president of the united states is responsible for appointing supreme court judgesand guess whos going to be president in two months
 the grubhub crash 
after matt maloney ceo of the online food delivery service grubhub proclaimed in an email that if you agree with trumps politics you should resign their stock dropped by nearly  in just a few days
since this time in addition to his companys stock tanking he has received ample backlash on sites of all manner from twitter to facebook to reddit to independent blogs to major altright news centers
this is what my fellow rok contributors and manosphere bloggers were talking about when they mentioned the tangible impact of trump voters hillarys supporters lack the characteristics necessary to make change
a burning passion and sense of purpose moral fortitude and a sense of justice selfconfidence and the courage to stand up for your rights a fucking spine this is why we will win period the antitrump crowd is based around having a massive entitlement complex a victim complex not thinking for yourself and being a blind social sheep do people like this ever have any political or financial power in the world
of course not who do you think all of the hard working businessmen are all of the entrepreneurs all of the people investing in the stock market in order to take control of their financial future hard working intelligent men who dont make excuses obviously and do you know what these are the types of men that voted for donald trump
why do you think the dow jones industrial average is at an all time high because trumps win restored faith in america
 rise of the new media 
the mainstream media has repeatedly shown to be completely incompetent in regards to actually reporting on the issues they are nothing more than a puppet show meant to distract entertain and brainwash the american public
they have consistently lied about candidates manipulated the evidence falsified facts skewed statistics and polls and defamed multiple individuals for a mere political opinion this will happen no longer
with the rise of the new media more and more men have begun establishing outlets across all platforms reddit twitter facebook youtube periscope the list goes on and on
i firmly believe that the next eight years will be looked back on by historians as one of the most important times in all of humanitys time on this earth 
america has brought the world stability we have stood as a symbol and an ideal for other countries to follow we are a monolith of free speech bravery and economic prosperityand the elites have tried to destroy all of this to satisfy their greedy little egos
the men of america will not have this over the past  years cough obamas presidency cough we have seen an exponential increase in not only the quantity of alternative news outlets but also the quality
sites that were merely blogs a few years ago have evolved into fullblown news syndicates with live reporting onsite video footage and actual news anchors this is literally the people fighting back we want freedom of speech and we will have it
while the mainstream media draws its final breath theyre proclaiming that theres this new radical whitenationalist group called the altright in an attempt to make us look like evil fascists in fact i just had somebody threaten to kill me on twitter  but was he banned of course not
this repeated favoring of violent mentally ill leftists makes it very clear what the msms agenda istotal control and a complete suppression of our freedoms of speech sorry but the alternative media isnt going to let this happen
 massive boycotts of antitrump companies 
the lefts hypocrisy never ceases to amaze me somehow they can completely legally destroy an independent family owned business for simply refusing to bake a gay couple a cake but when trump supporters simply boycott a multibillion dollar conglomerate were the ones that are hateful
in response to several ceos statements regarding trumps racism and hate the men and women who voted for donald trump decided to simply boycott them despite this completely legal and antiviolent response the left is up in arms
here is a list of companies whose ceos have been caught attacking donald trump and his proamerican policies
pepsico they own pepsi lays mountain dew starbucks and more nabisco their brands include oreo chips ahoy ritz and more netflix macys ben  jerrys each and every single one of these companies has either spoken out against trump directly has refused to do business with trump or has moved factory production outside of the us such as nabisco which has started moving production to mexico some companies such as ben  jerrys have even openly supported the terrorist movement black lives matter 
again what do these actions signify in trump supporters power assertiveness courage a willingness to take action this is why donald trump wonhis supporters are grown ups not little babies who want more safe spaces and antifree speech zones
when donald trumps voters get oppressed by the biased controlled media or by elite globalists they dont whine or cry about it they just do something they protest and stop supporting companies that are shipping our jobs away they speak out in a logical rational way against the anger and hatred that the left has towards white men
they take their lives into their own hands rather than relying on a stupid system that caters to cry babies and whiners they take their health into their own hands they take their finances into their own hands and they take their relationships into their own hands
they dont wait around for someone else to do it for themthey get it done themselves this is why trump got into office and this is why were going to make america great again

"home this month popular the path men took to trump the path men took to trump 
daryush roosh valizadeh created rok in october  you can visit his blog at rooshvcom or follow him on twitter and facebook rss november   politics 
every man who supports donald trump came to it from a different path some of you support him because of economic impoverishment or because you have seen your neighborhoods degrade from illegal immigrants  or maybe you support him because you were attacked for being politically incorrect for me and many other men we came to support trump because we shared truths about sex and the true nature of women  the fight began in  with the southern poverty law center 
in march  after years of teaching men how to improve their sex lives through books and web sites  i was put on a list by the jewishoperated southern poverty law center for being a misogynist  i was shaken up by this because i knew that my desire to enjoy sex with beautiful women and share the truths ive learned from it put me on a path of no return either i close down shop immediately or accept that the mob would one day come pounding on my door 
i decided to keep going i responded to the splc designation with an article titled my existence is becoming illegal  where i described how heterosexual sex was now a defiant political act if the male received any benefit from it 
it is clear that gender hate is now a oneway street men can hate women but not the other way around men can rape women cant men can be abusive both physically and emotionally but women cant men can be misogynist but women cant be misandrist a word that is unknown to most of the american population men can be described as lazy slobs who play video games all day but women are perfect asis in a country where there are organizations trying to convince you that being fat is both healthy and beautiful male teachers get sent to poundmeintheass prison if they have sex with a student but female teachers only get a slap on the wrist if youre a man youre likely a perpetrator of hate violence and abuse to innocent american women even if you dont yet realize your thought crime but never the other way around 
fast forward two years to october  witch hunts by leftists were in force rage mobs were crawling through social networking looking for racists homophobes and sexists with the aim of getting them fired i studied the people who were participating in these witch hunts and wrote one of the most important articles ive ever published what is a social justice warrior sjw  
the article was widely shared influencing how people viewed the useful idiot layer of individuals who were guided and controlled by establishment forces consisting of academia the corporate news media hollywood fortune  companies silicon valley and the billionaire owners of our politicians scratch a feminist sjw and youll find the reptilian skin of a billionaire who created the narrative she believes 
i was pessimistic when i wrote the sjw article thinking wed need a full generation  years to even begin defeating such a powerful antiamerican entity  i focused on teaching men selfdefense and avoidance instead of ways to defeat them little did i know that i was defining them at their absolute peak and barely two years later a candidate who stood for the diametric opposite of social justice would win the presidency the social justice warriors havent gone away and they are rushing to fulfill the will of george soros by refusing to accept the results of a fair election but the power they have to force people to bend to their demands has been reduced along with the power of the institutions that support them 
though sjwism peaked in  i had to face the full brunt of their attacks in the summer of  during the canadian stops of my lecture tour and again in february  during the international meetups  i survived those attacks and the fact that im still here right now and able to exercise my free speech on all my platformswhile youre still here participatingshows clearly how little power they really had to stop us they bruised me during the meetup outrage but i healed quickly enough to weaponize my sites to spread my support of an even bigger enemy of theirs donald trump donald trump ground zero 
im a pessimist by nature so i didnt have much hope that the establishment would allow trump to win in the primaries even though i was confident his ideas resonated with most americans but then i noticed that he simply couldnt be knocked out no matter what his enemies did i saw him humiliate jeb bush  outcompete a resurgent ted cruz and smack down any attempt by the media to force him to display weakness by the time i attended the republican national convention in cleveland  i started to believe 
the ground zero for donald trump within the manosphere was the donald trump thread on the forum created in june  by veteran member and rok contributor samseau  this is where the battle unfolded for thosuands of men over  pages long the thread has been viewed nearly  million times ideas within it have filtered out into mainstream discourse as described here  to men with bullhorns larger than i have 
after significant battles in a real war medals are awarded but soldiers dont nitpick on who was the best soldier they all worked as a team to ensure victory from the general donald trump the colonels his advisers the captains major media influencers like alex jones matt drudge paul joseph watson and mike cernovich the sergeants men like myself the specialists men like samseau and on down to the private a regular commenter who contributes the occasional meme or argument in his spare time 
the ego cares about how impactful one is how influential its ideas are but the team player only cares about victory for the whole whether i am a private or a sergeant i fought side by side with men in that thread and on this web site to what amounts to a modern fourthgenerational informational war that will be studied by historians in the future who would have guessed that public internet sites operating on free opensource software would have such a positive effect on not just the result of the election but on the lives of so many men who participated in it approaching the date of the election 
two months before the election i did a youtube video urging men to vote for trump  and it resulted in nearly  unsubscribes within a day surprising even me since i thought my audience was mostly men who would automatically support a trump presidency the video echoed a lot of sentiments i shared in the article if donald trump doesnt win were screwed  where i tried to convey the danger of a hillary presidency 
obama was the race president and look how badly he has damaged race relations in only eight years hillary will be the gender president the future we have in store should be absolutely clear to you if she happens to defeat trump 
not only will she move to establish a technomatriarchy where men are secondclass citizens to any female but she will ensure that no movement or organization will be able to challenge her or her establishment cronies ever again this isnt a trivial matter of getting banned from a web site like twitter or youtubemany of you will be forced to escape the country for no other reason than you happening to be a man who found himself on the wrong side of the establishment 
for the next month i stared at the calendar waiting for the election to happen doing what i could to push back against the narrative on twitter  then in early october an old tape was released of trump saying he grabs girls by the pussy because they let him my sister called me confused and asked if he really was a bad man i told her that the media is distorting his comments just like they distorted mine a few months earlier when their proclaimed me as a  prorape advocate  i told her not to believe the media and to judge trump by his actions and his policies not a gotcha moment that was being spun out of control to help hillarys failing campaign 
i spoke to her with confidence but inside i was concerned in a politically correct world would this be the blow to sink trumps candidacy is the majority of americans actually ready to defeat political correctness thankfully trump responded strongly ignoring calls by the traitors in the republican party to step down 
the first poll to come in after pussygate suggested that trumps support didnt decline the fake controversy didnt work i held my breath for the next few days to see if another tape would come out maybe of him saying the nword but none did and i knew the establishment had no more bullets this was the moment where i finally believed i felt a rush of energy on that day as my subconscious accepted that trump was going to win i did a periscope that night as if i was amped up on methamphetamine but i took no drug 
from that point on it was just a matter of hanging on until finally on november  when he was elected president i was in disbelief after he won because it was only four years prior when i was attacked by the same forces that were aligned against trump i didnt have to wait long until my personal enemies were dealt a monstrous defeat by another man whom i consider on the same team as us if i made any miscalculation it was that it would take a generation or longer for us to begin pushing back against establishment forces i underestimated our own power and those of our allies in the alternative internet space human control is a foolhardy endeavor 
the most important lesson i learned from trumps victory is how pointless it is to control human beings both their behaviors and their minds every single major institution in the united states represented by billions of dollars of economic activity and influence could not stop a populist candidate in spite of trying everything short of assassination 
george soros and his billions werent effective obama and his allies werent effective the mainstream media and their dozens of outlets werent effective ceos of the biggest companies in the united states werent effective hollywood and its superstars werent effective academia and its thousands of professors werent effective social media and its censorship efforts werent effective the fbi allowing hillary to skate from real crimes wasnt effective even donald trumps own party wasnt effective in stopping him its absolutely incredible that all these forces couldnt stop one man and his believers what a disgrace to the fields of scientific management and modern propaganda for them all to fail so miserably 
think right now of how much effort the antitrump forces put into stopping him from winning think of how much money they spent to guarantee their desired outcome and now think how it was all for nothing  they accomplished the very opposite of what they moved mountains to accomplish after decades of cementing their control within the country by sucking the truth and life blood from the american public 
whatever term you use to describe the force that governs our existencenature god tao or so onit is clear that humans cannot control it all and that the pendulum will swing when it wants to swing that the wheel of history will turn when it wants to turn and your billions of dollars and your propaganda and your institutions can do nothing to stop it imagine how impotent george soros and his friends must feel after their limitless money and influence was all for nothing 
now they have to perfect their control methods even more open their pocket books further and try to force their will upon a population as if pushing food into the mouth of someone who is already full their desire to control you is nothing but their own psychological failings of trying to alleviate their crippling fears of trying to prove to themselves and to the world that they are a somebody that they are powerful that the world must be shaped into their image that they are gods among men but it should be clear to you by now that they are not gods but sociopaths who gamed an economic system to amass huge amounts of capital and money much of that will be flushed down the drain as they continue to fight and grasp their way to unequivocal defeat or attempting to control those who do not want to be controlled 
you can control human beings but only temporarily and only some of them at the end of the day humans want to do what they want to do and if you dont possess what they wish to buy they will go to someone who does no matter how much money you spend on your mechanisms of control the more you control what does not want to be controlled the more tension is created and then released in the great unraveling of which we are currently living through in previous eras that tension resulted in victorious parades on the streets but in our modern era it is in the form of online celebrations with the use of tweets and memes 
if you want to be a true leader of society create an environment where humans can associate with whom they want can freely engage in commerce can create families can live in safety can search for the truth without interference and can work and play and live according to their nature put stone walls blocking their righteous will and watch them be torn down it may take a decade it may take  years but it will happen and the contraptions you used to control them will reveal not your strength but your own pathetic weakness conclusion 
we are tired of being controlled leave us alone we are tired of institutions that are obsessed with controlling us of forcing us to believe in falsehoods of programming us to hate our country of pitting woman against man and black against white leave us alone let men be men and from that a new american renaissance will come forth men who are strong and good must be allowed to live their lives and if you prevent us from doing so we wont allow you to live yours we will humiliate your useful idiots we will destroy your institutions we will lash out with more than just memes 
im afraid that those who stand against us are gearing up for even greater authoritarian control over us but at least now we have our man in the white house who can join us in a fight that we have already been battling for many years i cant wait to see where this fight takes us next nov   roosh valizadeh",Fake
"submit home this month popular  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby  reasons why you should try photography as a hobby photography really is one of the most rewarding hobbies a man could pursue ness nomadison 
ness is a thirtysomething american with almost a decade of experience living and traveling across asia hes a strong believer in pursuing ones passions continual selfimprovement and just being the best man he can be he runs his own website nessthenomadcom  november   lifestyle 
have you ever had a curiosity in photography yet you werent sure if its a hobby really worthy of your limited time then this article was written for you as i was also once in your shoes 
i picked up a dslr camera for the first time back in  which awoke a passion inside me that i never even knew was there three and half years later im here to tell you just a few of the many benefits and realizations ive experienced by taking on this timeless hobby here are eight reasons photography might just be the most meaningful hobby youve overlooked your entire life  an opportunity to flex your creative muscle 
in order to be balanced human beings i believe people need to be physically healthy spiritually awake and creatively expressive photography just like writing and film is a selfless way to be creative while also giving something back to the world 
the way we interpret our world changes from individual to individual and photography provides a medium for people to express themselves ask ten different photographers to photograph the same thing  a city for example  and be prepared to see ten wildly different visions of the same subject in our sensoryoverload world it feels good to create something thats uniquely you  appreciate and understand your surroundings more 
i now find myself seeing everything around me in rectangular framesa takeaway from having to frame so many pictures over the years oh those people over there would fit perfectly into a  box or that building over there would look perfect boxed in from this angle my eyes are now sharper than ever 
but i also find myself observing and appreciating all the little things around me i always have to keep my camera nearby because i often want to photograph something ive noticed in my daily routine the pattern on a sewer lid a reflection in a puddle birds perched in a tree and so forth 
my prephotographer self just like most of the rest of the world would have walked right past these things without a care in the world yet now i can be entertained from the most minuscule and simple things especially if my camera is handy the world is full of photogenic things if can just teach yourself to notice them  help preserve history 
since its inception photography has always been one of the most moving ways to preserve history in our rapidly changing modern times photos touch people in a way other media cant both photography and video are both visual arts but photographs differ in that they capture merely one frame of what is going on yet one frame is all one needs to feel taken back to another time 
with the advent of the smartphone photography is as accessible as ever while this sounds good on paper the truth is our worlds becoming more and more flooded with garbage and narcissistic photographs our world needs more adventurous and welltrained photographers out there taking photos of the modern world we live in and the rapid changes its undergoing these are the photos that will be cherished decades down the road not all the shitty selfies that bog down social media  travel experiences will be more meaningful 
photography goes with traveling like bread goes with butter it took me nearly five years of traveling internationally to finally get serious about doing photography on my trips and after i got started i never looked back 
rather than traveling for escapism and hedonism im traveling to learn about and document our world as a result my trips feel much more meaningful and fulfilling than they ever did before the way you see and come to understand a country as a photographer is quite different than if you werent one 
i now divide my history of travel experiences into two separate groupsthe trips i had before i owned a dslr camera and the trips i had after buying one photography is so fun and addicting that i find myself wanting to go back to all those predslr camera destinations even the ones i didnt enjoy all that much just so i can reexperience them with a camera in hand  an opportunity to meet new people 
one thing i always try to do when i travel is meet fellow photographers whether they be foreign or local i appreciate talking to people with an observational eye as they can provide me with unique insight that nonphotographers rarely can 
but photography doesnt just help you meet other photographers it helps you meet other people from all walks of life ive had regular people on the street come up and talk to me once they saw i was taking photos ive also met people from online for no other reason than they liked my work 
being a good photographer can also be a great way to meet women theyre not gonna start blowing you as soon as they see your awesome pictures but dont be surprised if you discover some newfound female admiration once your excellent photography skills are out in the open and if you can make a woman look beautiful in a photo shell admire you in a way you never imagined  a blog with an edge 
in the diverse world of independently run blogs how many bloggers do you know who can both write well and photograph well i can literally only think of one  and the fact that this blogger is just as good at utilizing a camera as he is at wielding a pen or rather a keyboard puts his website in a league of its own in terms of quality content 
though i still highly respect the good bloggers out there for their amazing writing skills and insights i think theyre doing both their readers and websites a great disservice by merely using stock photos or shitty shotwithacellphone photos in their articles 
readers can definitely tell the difference when a blogger takes all of their own photos with a nice dslr camera start taking nice dslrshot photos and see for yourself how they can enhance your articles theyll give you just that much more of an edge over all the other bloggers who dont  youll also have an edge over  of others on social media and dating sites 
since everyone else is posting lame smartphonetaken shots all over their social media accounts your dslrshot photos could shine like diamonds in the rough the same way you stand above  of other men by lifting weights regularly the same advantage can be expected by not taking cheap shortcuts with your social mediabound photography your facebook instagram and twitter accounts will all look better than ever before 
this is also true for dating websites and apps where most chumps just take some lame mirror selfies with their smartphone and then upload them to their accounts dudes with welltaken nontraditional photos stand out big time dont just take my word for it as there has actually been plenty of discussion about these benefits over at the roosh v forum  
and although they can be very helpful you dont actually need another photographer with you to get some good shots of yourself rather all you need is your camera an autofocus lens a tripod a remote shutter and a creative eye  a resumeenhancing marketable skill 
photography isnt just mentally rewarding it can also be financially rewarding if you play your cards right the field of profitable photography may be vast and highly competitive but one things for sure  the demand for new photographs is infinite the world never stops turning after all stock portrait wedding wildlife travel sports and news photography are just a few of the most in demand and profitable niches 
but if you really wanna make money selling your photographs you gotta make a name for yourself by sharpening your skills and networking with the right people a great photographer who no one knows exists wont make any money 
my father is an outdoorsman slash wildlife photographer with decades of experience tens of thousands of photos and a giant network of contacts from his industry it seems like magazine and website editors are always knocking on his door because they know he probably has a nice shot of exactly what theyre looking for often all he has to do is dig through his archives and boomhes made  bucks conclusion 
stop dreaming about it and just give photography a shot already borrow your friend or a family members dslr camera for the weekend and just get out there and take pictures of anything that strikes your fancy 
photography takes decades to master but it all begins with a single click of the shutter button yet sometimes all it takes is one little click to realize youve been missing out on something very big and meaningful your entire life youll never know until you try",Fake
"more people are coming to the truthful conclusion that globalism is a failure and nationalism where a countrys people and interests are valued above that of noncitizens is the way forward a problem is that the globalismnationalism framework is exactly the type of dialectic elites can use to usher in a global war or crackdown to further increase their power
imagine there is a wife who is tired of her husband going out every night with his friends to drink instead of nagging at him every evening which would have the effect of motivating him to leave the house even sooner she will wait until he gets into a drunk driving accident or serious bar fight so she could draw the line and make the reasonable ultimatum for him to never drink again the husband is more likely to listen to her after something wrong takes place than after he had a safe night out
right now the nationalist movement is being allowed to gain strength so that a future event can act as a trigger for globalists to draw the line on the movement by imprisoning or killing its strongest members in other words globalists plan to use nationalism as a trap a device they transform into to their advantage as of right now the budding nationalist movement is extremely useful in allowing them to identify all resisters before easily crushing them when the time is right
elites cannot advance their plans without a dialectic 
the way the elites move an agenda forward is through a dialectic  meaning that two opposing ideologies rub against each other create friction and from that comes a desired result ie order from chaos those in power either control or monitor the existence of both sides to guide and bend the dialectic to serve their ends
the recent rise in nationalism i speculate has been allowed because previous dialectics such as capitalism vs communism and democracy vs terrorism are no longer useful in advancing the desired agenda soviet communism is dead and increased terrorism did not allow planned wars in syria and iran to proceed like  did with iraq and afghanistan in addition the white vs black race war is years late stubbornly resistant to the gasoline that obama pours onto the fire a new dialectic must be nurtured and so nationalism may just do the trick hillarys recent alt right speech officially debuted american nationalism as the new enemy
while your conclusion that nationalism is logical and beneficial to a nation is true and im sure to agree with it you were guided onto those beliefs how did you arrive at nationalist thought through decades of free trade feminism and opendoor immigration that have worn you and your country down your arrival at nationalist conclusions is the direct result of globalism which means that nationalist thoughts exist in your mind only because of the likes of george soros who pulled out a million muslims from his hat and placed them in europe while sponsoring a multitude of social justice organizations in the united states his actions and behavior along with other powerful globalists like him have essentially created your very ideology because you are entrenched in a dialectic where opposing forces must exist and be in combat with each other
the growth of nationalism is useful nationalism must continue to grow in power right before the moment it can threaten globalist banking and geopolitical interests and when it does the globalists will clamp down severely on it as if replaying world war  they will identify a nationalist country as the big bad bully and then use that country as an excuse to start a war that will simultaneously weed out nationalists throughout the world by sending them to die or having them arrested at home for subversion or treason russia is the evil nationalist country that neocons and others have been poking and even poland is being puffed up into an undemocratic country in order to hedge their bets

a hint that this may already be taking place is that france recently called upon patriots to serve in their national guard to protect citizens since when does france care about patriots they have committed no consistent actions in the past decade that suggest they do care so we must reasonably conclude that this new army is a trap to attract nationalists into a game where the end result is their death i wouldnt be surprised if frances beefedup army is used to start a war in a place like poland which will be painted as an aggressor that caused economic attacks upon the saintly western europeans
as long as youre in the dialectic which i see as a sort of twilight zone creation of the mega rich youre fighting on their terms they need the nationalist grassroots uprising to create violent events that allow them to reassert control and power even though nationalism may be the most sane movement of the day it still plays into their hands as long as we insist on having only two sides of the debate good and evil as if we were living in a hollywoodstyle storyline instead of this twodimensional arrangement the solution may be to go d where you can move front and back and around in a spectrum of ideas instead of just left and right where youre a pawn of the game no matter what side you pick
just because a nationalist resistance is growing doesnt mean that that the globalists in power are being hurt without being able to effectively control the western population through the cold war terrorism racial divideandconquer or modern russian aggression they are hoping that the nationalist movement grows enough to create the conflict that moves their chess pieces forward while im not urging you to throw away your nationalist beliefs as i surely wont throw away mine it is clear to me that a trap is waiting to be sprung and we will all suffer when its finally launched

"its now been over a week since the most glorious victory ever recorded in the war against rapacious globalism and lunatic cultural marxismthe election of donald trump to the presidency of the united states like many of you i was outside with my fellow tribesmen  the same tribe our opponents tried to shut down in february  until about  am on election day as you may expect it was a joyous occasion that ill never forget

yet as i remarked at the time while this was a glorious victory a decisive one that ended the campaign the war would continue i had hoped to be as magnanimous as possible in victory to finally bridge some divides and begin to move past the insanity weve been dealing with thats accelerated in the past few years however as has quickly become apparent the cultural marxists sjws and their globalist overlords have no intention of coming to terms or engaging in meaningful selfreflection anytime soon instead theyre doubling down on everything that voters resoundingly rejected on november th
predictably there have been protests and some riots incidents of violence on the left have taken place and gone underreported just as predictably most of these protests are professionally organized  with george soros likely pulling at least a few of the strings learning nothing the regressive leftists taking to the streets complete with their year zero pathology think themselves morally justified in blocking streets and attacking people because theyre on a mission to purify society anything that stands in the way of that mission can be justly eliminated 
i came across one of these protests a few days ago it was generic and small basic bitch shit really but recall that these are merely the peons in the army of their overlords their intensity will dissipate with time the safetypin wearing safespace occupying neonhaired freaks arent the ones to take note of on the grand strategic map the bigger picture to focus on is the drive toward increased censorship in the past few days
the recent counteroffensive began with the uproar over donald trumps selection of steve bannon to be his chief white house strategist the media and its acolytes on social media went into another coordinated attack lambasting bannon and breitbart  which he ran as having connections to the altright which in turn they say is associated with white nationalism to reinforce this pairing the media ran with a couple of the most controversial breitbart headlines
if you recognize this tactic its because the media ab tested this against roosh in february they took the  how to stop rape  headline said that it proved that roosh was prorape and then repeated endlessly
this is actually a sort of hypnosis trick and was certainly done deliberately scott adams calls this wordthinking 
rational people use data and reason to arrive at truth this group is mostly imaginary
wordthinkers use labels word definitions and analogies to create the illusion of rational thinking this group is  of the world
persuaders use simplicity repetition emotion habit aspirations visual communication and other tools of persuasion to program other people and themselves this group is about  of the population and effectively control the wordthinkers of the world
he further describes the phenomenon of wordthinking 
wordthinking is important to persuasion because if you can convince someone to accept a label on an opponent it turns off their critical thought and turns on their confirmation bias nuance is lost context is lost all that matters once the label is accepted is whatever qualities the label already contained
and this is what the media is doing they did it with roosh and are now doing their damndest to do it to bannon no doubt as one of the thousand paper cuts they hope to use to take president trump down
because the term altright is relatively fresh its vulnerable to being defined with the most ominous dark terms possible which is why the media is trying furiously to create as much connective tissue between it and white nationalism as possible remember with wordthinking nuance and context are lost
and now that this first step has been achieved where it was meant to the selfanointed moral cover for the more alarming stage of the counteroffensive is underway now that the ambiguous and ominoussounding altright has been attempted to be extensively defined the solution is obviously to crack down on it and anyone having to do with it even if they really dont given this pretext the purges and censorship have begun with numerous prominent twitter accounts being suspended agree with these accounts or not i often dont it should give you pause that this kind of blanket censorship is being implemented if youre just a little bit politically unorthodox youre now at heightened risk of being slapped with the altright label even if youre on record as not identifying with it and banned from outlets of communication that are both vital for pushing your ideas forward and for promoting any business you have
but banning individuals is only stage one stage two is the recent drive by google facebook twitter and others to censor what they call fake news the media has been on a blitz against these fake news articles completely unironically given that this is the same crowd that uncritically signal boosted the rolling stone rape hoax to the ends of the world fact checks donald trumps comment that hillary clinton acid washed her private email server selectively edits clips to promote the narrative that their pets in black lives matter are entirely peaceful when they arent  and fails to disclose contacts and relationships with officials of the democratic national committee while writing about the campaign
no this is not the onion
while this drive deserves to be a subject of laughter we must nevertheless still take it seriously there have already been reports of shadow bans on twitter with prominent figures such as mike cernovich and scott adams and its far from out of the question that a blacklist of sorts gets put up for outlets such as return of kings  which were crucial in taking control of the narrative during the campaign all the while the media continues to nitpick inflate and manufacture anything they can turn into a controversy about the incoming trump administration narrative warfare is far from over
what can we do fortunately we have a master persuader in donald trump to lead the way but we at the grassroots the grunts in the trenches if you will must continue our efforts
first we need to begin to dehypnotize those that can be scott adams had some thoughts on that  but here are the crucial points
 the basis of the hypnosis in recent days has been around pairing the terms altright and fake news with all sorts of bad things
 take away that pairing and youve made significant inroads
ive ab tested this sort of thing numerous times remember mike cernovichs maxim that conflict is attention and attention is influence here are a few pointers
 just like with women frame control is paramount the inevitable tactic that theyll try to use is to associate anyone opposed to them with the worst elements of their side fortunately our opponents have arguably worse elements given their blanket of moral superiority and cultural influence refocus the frame on those make them own their own worst elements
 appeal to vanity most people like to think of themselves as rational tell them that their wordthinking is literally shutting down their critical thinking skills i did this with a girl after the first debate explaining to her that because the movie in her head pictured a mexican in a certain way her critical thinking skills turned off and that what trump said about the mexican judge would be equally applicable to someone of another heritage like german its a long story but her face was a picture tell them that theyre seeing things not based on reality but on the movies playing in their heads triggered by a certain word then watch the cognitive dissonance come
on the broader level heres what we can do
 continue on as usual continue to make a cultural impact get those websites books movies and so on out there echoing what one member of the forum said politics is air cover culture is the ground war they can try to censor fake news all they want but we are too numerous to control if we dont cooperate its now time to redouble our efforts
 dont talk to any aggrieved victimhood class on social media if theyre acting hostile to you theyll use any excuse to ban you law  disdain things you cannot have ignoring them is the best revenge
 begin to build new networks gab is up and coming and is far more free speech friendly
 i will echo what many others have said on the forum make fun of them theyre a prime target for humor believe me when i say most people are sick of the special snowflakes on the street as well as the media

this is a time of great opportunity but we need to readjust for the new moves our opponents are making theyre doing everything they can to censor us and delegitimize trump thats the next focus of the campaign we must delegitimize them in turn
but take heart that were now in the ascendant otherwise they wouldnt be making these moves i recall when i first visited return of kings and the forum nearly four years ago there was a general malaise in the atmosphere day after day it seemed we were suffering another defeat no longer

"convinced that previous snow plowing policies were sexist the city government of the swedish capital of stockholm recently implemented a feminist system for clearing it it ended in disaster and the city came to an absolute standstill for a start four times as many people than usual were hospitalized for snowrelated injuries nearly as importantly countless workers most of them men were prevented from getting to work it would appear that the patriarchybacked snow won as local politicians ended up apologizing for the havoccausing changes
havoc like this

forgetting that motor vehicles are often more impeded by snow than pedestrians and create a greater safety risk municipal resources which had already been increased were diverted to clearing bicycle paths and sidewalks and away from main roads areas like schools were also prioritized which again ignores the frequently greater ease of walking in snow than driving in it plus the longer distances car commuters face compared to children mothers and other women walking to places the situation is quite plainly moronic for a further reason nonmain roads and other parts of a city take up much more space meaning that the swedish capitals snow removal teams were targeting a far larger less densely used zone to boot this was all during a november already breaking records for snowfall 
the saga in stockholm reads like an microcosm of feminism itself an overeducated meaning undereducated group of leftists come together create data based on feelings and produce a plan of action that screws up an entire community feminists in stockholm had previously complained that the thoroughfares cleaned up first and most extensively by snowplows were the ones heavily used by men how they came to this conclusion is unclear but given the shutdown of the city that resulted from the feminist changes it wasnt based on any solid reasoning with private cars and public transport vehicles alike unable to move in many cases the femalefriendly snowclearing ended up adversely impacting far more people including women than the old one
well done feminists and white knights
what this says about sweden is it really surprising that one of the people responsible for stockholms femalefriendly snow plowing scandal mayor karin wanngÃ¥rd is a feminist and career politician who first joined the council in her teens
because sweden is perhaps the most concentrated welfare state in the world not having people at their jobs and instead stuck in snow is a very bad thing how can a country continue to pay such a large bill for handouts with elected representatives of the caliber of stockholms trying to ruin things sweden is also home to a growing class of lowskilled migrant communities including many tens of thousands from the most recent mediterranean waves last year its recent migrant population is now essentially the same proportionallyspeaking as states more typically associated with multiculturalism such as canada and australia and nonethnic swedes in sweden tend to come from more troublesome cultures compared to the more assimilationfriendly east asians and indians emigrating to canada and australia
how sweden intends to deal with issues like this while balancing urgent economic needs remains to be seen especially with braindead initiatives like the snow plow fiasco taking precedence add to the mix the recent creation of a mansplaining hotline by a swedish labor union and you start to see the real problems scandinavias most basketcase society is trying to solve
so who was organizing the snow plowingand actually doing it yup you guessed it its a man driving
theres no doubt that the feminist snow plowing scheme was an unmitigated disaster and its also extremely likely that the vast majority of people tasked with clearing stockholms streets are men oh the irony not only do feminist politicians try to preference women in the removal of snow they expect men to do the work in achieving it just as sanitation workers and garbage collectors are invariably male dont expect to catch too many female snowplow operators and other snowclearing employees in stockholm
wake up sweden swedish multiculturalism in action
stockholms snow removal catastrophe is emblematic of a country refusing to deal with its real malaise while the men who built sweden are categorized as wouldbe oppressors swedish society itself is close to breaking point even stockholms central train station is now terribly unsafe and various city police forces have long made it known that they do not have control of many suburbs in particular malmÃ¶ swedens third city and certain districts of stockholm are notorious for ethnic ghettos gang violence rape and other crime
but no mansplaining hotlines and not removing snow in a new feminist way are the clear and present dangers most swedes should fear at night

"as feminism erodes down to its tattooed lesbian core we should stop and take a moment to wonder what the point of the third wave part of feminism was although it ultimately proves destructive to western societies to give women equality at least the first and second wave had something legitimate to bitch about third wave feminism not so much and today well talk about the underlying motives and the end game of it all
when one looks at modern feminism you see women who have flipped the script to use their term and rewired life so that men are not necessary for them a modern feminist has her own job that can meet her needs but maybe not all her wants and has her own small place with her cats and netflix when she wants the company of men she goes out and sluts it up and is always successful due to the biological imperative of men
on the surface a feminist woman may appear to be the analog of a red pill man yet upon closer examination she is actually an imperfect copy a man works harder more dangerous jobs and makes more money because of it thus he has money for anything he wants and more a proper man has interesting hobbies and a healthy fit lifestyle and he must do this to fulfill his potential and inner drive but also because he realizes that normal men do not get laid due to hypergamy and he must be the best he can be if he wants to be successful with women
however the most crucial difference lies in the outcome women who outlast their shelf lives while still being single are miserable and i fully expect the suicide rate of women of my generation to skyrocket in about  years from now men whose value is based on their production and can enjoy a later in life peak than women also can live for other things than companionship and family and can be quite happy on their own even if they did want a family at one time or still do
so the question is if women despite their feminist pandering to the contrary actually do want a man to live with and grow old with why is third wave feminism devoted to stopping that in every which way the answer like most things lies in the red pill philosophy women including feminists only want the best men modern feminism is nothing more than a nuclearlevel shit test
a woman needs an alpha man like a fish needs water sjw society today tells us that men are not supposed to hit on women in the grocery store in the bookstore or at the coffee shop because thats a precursor to stalking or some shit at night youre not supposed to hit on girls at the bar or club because they are there with the friends and not looking for that at work youre not even supposed to talk to women about anything other than workrelated topics because thats harassment
if you are wondering where is a guy supposed to meet girls then you get the point and the answer is that youre not feminists and women in general know that any man who actually allows them to regulate his behavior is not a man worth having in the first place so they are only interested in men that see that the answer to feminisms constraints is to ignore them in the first place

combining the above shit test with hypergamy will result in a winning combo if a man is successful good looking and alpha enough he has a good chance of pulling another mans wife directly out of their marriage and family and taking her away women are ultimately interested only in their own self interest and that means when confronted with the best man she has ever beheld she will go against feminism because it is not in her own best self interest at the time and instead be receptive to the man in hopes of snaring him
ultimately women do still need and want men they just dont want to be bothered by inferior men and third wave feminism does a good job of convincing the betas to stay away until they are wanted for their paychecks by postwall nascarstyle wrecks of women
when is enough enough when you look at feminism logically which is hard you can come up with the premise that women have been disadvantaged over history and feminism is an effort to balance the scales they will disguise it in selfdepreciating irony feminism is the radical notion that men and women are equal but what they really men is that men and women should be equal over the balance of history and since women have been so disadvantaged men had better get ready for some suck to square the accounts
i bet shes been in  rok articles by now
the question then follows if men owe women how much are we talking can it ever be paid off or have women been so heinously treated over the entirety of our existence that there will never be enough atonement to make up for it i have three theories
it could be that men have apparently treated women so badly for all time that it can never be paid off because its an absolute the problem with absolutes is they lack scope the worst atrocities in history have been borne by both men and women alike and it could be said that men have borne the heavier half as they are usually expected to die before defeat in war whereas women although they get raped by the conquerors at least get to live i doubt most women have been treated that badly though on the balance so there is probably some finite amount of penance men would do to restore equality
the other two theories center on the idea that eventually men will atone for all faults perceived by feminism and the only difference lies in what happens then my second idea is not a noble one but it is probably the most accurate feminists you see are not for equality they are for female supremacy and once equality is reached women will get to be on top for millennia some would say we are already at that point and this is why anyone who is not a feminist can see why the movement has faltered and lost whatever relevance it ever had when you already have it all shouldnt you stop and try to actually make things equal that is if you actually have moral integrity
thats the third idea the concept of once all debts are paid true equality would rule i doubt this one would ever happen as our victimhoodempowerment culture makes it advantageous to be a victim and you cant be a victim if your demographic is on top plus being feelers not thinkers the average woman lacks the intellectual capacity to be honest with themselves
conclusion combining the idea of feminism being a massive shit test to guys and a scam to win money and prizes from society just because you have a vagina one can see that the only solution is to treat it like the cult bullshit it is while that is nothing new for those of us here at return of kings  and nothing new for those our message reaches the reason we must treat it like that has hopefully been a little more exposed to the light here
the reason that feminism makes no sense and makes it seem like all men have no way to succeed and must lose everything is because that is precisely the point there is no way to win there is no equality there is only female superiority males that go along with it and men that do not

there are those who think we should only get our news from official sources you know like the blonde telling you what to believe in between hocking a hockey game 
if theres anything the  election showed us its that the american people are increasingly distrustful of and not listening to the commands laid out by the once mainstream media theyre increasingly reticent to commit national and demographic suicide under the guise of diversity and other nebulous ideals theyre desperate not only to drain the swamp but to restore some sense of national pride and stability to the declining usa 
in response the controllers of the presstitutes the people who really run the world are already hard at work trying to find some way to create a false narrative about fake news sites in order to lay the ground work for censorship and control the internet has all but destroyed the corporategovernment narrative and there is a shit fit happening at the highest levels of the propaganda ministry ie cnn abc cbs nbc et al because they have learned the american people know how full of shit they really are 
sites like return of kings are on the front lines of this war in support of free speech and it is vitally important we stay on top of our game to avoid a reversion to the managed propaganda the centralized control of mass media gave us over the last  years hackers and leakers play right into the hands of the censorship narrative 
make no mistake one of the reasons leakers of misdeeds done by politicians and the elite they work for have been allowed to continue leaking dirty laundry is because it plays into the hands of those with designs on censorship and regaining control of the information the sheeple get to listen to having julian assange and edward snowden doing leaks of information and giving them extensive press coverage plays right into the hands of the censorship brigade because they can also play the protecting national security game when the time to silence dissent comes  
fake news is only the first assault in what is sure to become a full scale war on free speech on the internet we can be thankful trump won the election rather than the bitch since his election will slow the process of censorship but the aggressiveness of the fake news narrative shows us how determined some people are to shut us up and shut us down 
the new york times is already on the front lines of this assault on free speech on the internet only days after the bitch lost the election publisher arthur sulzberger published a mea culpa and promised to rededicate the newspaper to honest reporting 
we cannot deliver the independent original journalism for which we are known without the loyalty of our subscribers the new york times promises to give the news impartially without fear or favor we also approach the incoming trump administration without bias 
dont buy into it this is whats known in public relations as a diversion tactic while we focus on our seeming victory theyre already moving on to their next false narrative  socalled fake news no sooner than the ink dried on the promise to give trump a chance the new york times was moving to shut up the very people who made possible his rise to power  the altright and alternative news web sites 
while some fake news is produced purposefully by teenagers in the balkans or entrepreneurs in the united states seeking to make money from advertising false information can also arise from misinformed social media posts by regular people that are seized on and spread through a hyperpartisan blogosphere 
they did a spurious case study on how a rumor got started about protesters being bussed in to protest at trump rallies never mind the mainstream media is a business that runs lock stock and barrel on fake news almost every narrative they create is a false one one need do no more than a google search to discredit many if not most of the mainstream medias stories the hypocrisy is astounding pulling the plug facebook censorship algorithms are nothing compared to the elites agenda of eliminating free speech online 
whether or not the fake news narrative gains traction the next step will be for the elite to create a problem that affects millions of people online then follow through with the hegelian dialectic with a preordained solution to make everyone safer online and to stop the spread of false information while protecting free speech online by destroying it 
look for no less than a figurative internet  if the elite become desperate enough 
theyll pull the plug on the backbone of the internet shutting down ecommerce and communication online for a few days blame it on a fake news story just like benghazi was blamed on a youtube video then spring in to save us from ourselves by passing all sorts of creative laws and restrictions aimed at nothing more than eliminating competition to the corporategovernment narrative and gutting yet another of our bill of rights protections 
make no mistake freedom of speech is the most important of amendments to the constitution once that is taken away its game over obama has already floated the idea of silencing those of us who cling to our guns and religion and continues this narrative even after the election of trump 
obama has already been floating the idea of official news web sites this is nothing more than proposing the creation of the american equivalent of pravda in the soviet union in which only the stateapproved newspaper was considered the truth and everything else was considered lies obviously the new world order socialist narrative would be the only truth under a system such as this and traditional and conservative views would be relentlessly silenced 
check out what the messiah said in berlin recently 
in an age where theres so much active misinformation and its packaged very well and it looks the same when you see it on a facebook page or you turn on your television where some overzealousness on the part of a us official is equated with constant and severe repression elsewhere if everything seems to be the same and no distinctions are made then we wont know what to protect if we cant discriminate between serious arguments and propaganda then we have problems 
the fact he is saying these things should frighten you it should also make you angry this statement is a pc way of saying the goal of the power structure is to shut us the fuck up they want us to listen to clueless journalists who encourage the idea of microchipping your children and later yourselves so every aspect of your life can be controlled by the government 
we must fight back by discrediting the fake news narrative at every turn and informing those who will listen of the possibility of a fake internet  designed to give the government a reason to curb free expression on the very libertarian internet of today",Fake
"what motivates you to live what is the meaning of life
for centuries mankind has questioned everything mankinds quest for the answer to what drives us and what pushes us forward in times of darkness is not exempt from analysis in fact its been a consistent theme since the dawn of time stoicism  although not directly attributed to answering what drives us skirts around the topic and creates a general set of principles to help us deal with negative externalities in life
while many philosophers have pontificated on the subject of mankinds driving force and the will to live theres a problem inherent with such an analysis in order to research such a basic and instinctual topic one needs to experience a visceral cerebral experience that brings him or her to a basic instinctual level before having such an epiphany one needs to examine our animalistic base and then explore logically from there
one such analysis is known as logotherapy from the greek word logoswise  logotherapy developed by viktor frankl is an influential school of psychotherapy that is founded on the pillars of what motivates mankind before we delve into logotherapy however its important that we discuss viktor franklwho he was and why his unique perspective provides for an incredibly powerful source of credibility and authority

viktor frankl was born in  in what was at that time known as austriahungary frankl was a neurologist and psychiatrist his early life was relatively unspectacular but from an early age he displayed an interest in philosophy as well as psychotherapy initially interested in freud and adlers work he began to see their faults and eventually diverged from their teachingsbecoming particularly interested in depression as well as suicide
during  frankl in completing his residency in neurology was responsible for setting up the selbstmÃ¶rderpavillon  translated in english to the suicide pavilion its estimated that frankl along with his staff treated upwards of  women who had suicidal tendencies
in september of  his life was shaken frankl along with his wife and family were deported to a nazi concentration camp known as theresienstadt ghetto whilst there and during his stay at auschwitz frankl worked as a doctor in the psychiatric care unit focusing on mental health helping newcomers deal with shock and grief

in  after three years in a concentration camp frankl released his book entitled mans search for meaning  which details his experiences as a holocaust survivor as well as his theory which became known as logotherapy the book is divided into two partspart one is a detailed account of his experiences whereas part two discusses logotherapy
his time in the numerous concentration camps began to shape his philosophical and psychiatric theory while he had read books on the subject of psychological healing prior to his imprisonment he had never experienced it to the degree in which he had become accustomed to particularly intrigued as to why some prisoners lived longer than others frankl began to organize his thoughts and document how the average prisoners life in a concentration camp was reflected in their mind as a doctor focusing on grief and shockstricken inmates he was in a very unique position
hundreds and during some weeks thousands of helpless inmates were carted in auschwitz the mostfeared concentration camp weekly between the inmates sleeping next to him and those seeking treatment frankl noted that each prisoner without exception faced three stages of psychological reactions once entering the concentration camp these stages were shock apathy and depersonalization
while seemingly unimportant the noted documentation of these stages was very important for frankl as he began to notice while every inmate experienced these stages some experienced them to a less cerebral degree some inmates seemed less depressive than others and featured a happier disposition these inmateswith some expected variabilityoutlived the other inmates
discovery as he began to poke and prod frankl noticed something that separated these individuals from others hope there is never not meaning in life every moment no matter how painful dehumanizing or horrendous it is has meaning by extension frankl suggests even suffering is meaningful the inmates that survived the longestthe ones that outlived the rest had hope frankl suggested that he could tell whether or not an inmate would live just by looking at their facesthe face of a dejected depressed inmate was obvious and clear as day without hope they were doomed
everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of the human freedomsto choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way
the next question that frankl sought to answer was an important one and the foundational maxim of logotherapywhy did some men have hope and others not
the answer was love
the truth  that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire then i grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart the salvation of man is through love and in love i understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved
frankl in his book mans search for meaning recounted several instances where he would be driven into brief stints of depression after a beating during a latenight march in bare feet or watching his friend get treated inhumanely hed vacillate from depression by thinking and longing for his wife the men whom lasted the longest invariably had a wife or a job that they loved it was this motivator the unquantifiable love that pushed men in inhuman circumstances to existentially escape the physical realm and put mind above body
what we can get from this to answer this frankl codified three ways that he discovered is how we can find meaning in life  a job love and how we react to suffering its important to realize that while its easy to read this and assume that frankl is saying we should all suffer in order to find meaninghes not he is suggesting however that should we not have a jobdeed or love that allow us to find meaning in life we can still find meaning by choosing how to react in a negative situationour mental freedom is one of the only things that can never be taken from us theoretically speaking
the average man will never be faced with such a dire circumstance such as the atrocities that frankl and so many others dealt with what we can do however is choose how we react to lifes adversities
a fair assessment of logotherapy is that it provides a simplistic solution to a complex question life since life is such a complex series of events logotherapy offers a solution that may not be representative of lifes true hardships and intricacies in saying this my own personal evaluation is that this criticism in itself may have flaws by assuming that a complex question must have a complex solution even the assumption that life in complex can be debated its a cliched saying that life is hard or complexand even if it is its not out of the realm of possibility that a complex question has a simple solution  sometimes the answer we seek is right in front of us
viktor frankl died in september  and his works are still read today several logotherapy institutes exist today named after him

"what would you do if you saw two boys of  years wrestling their shirts off red and sweaty they have a large group of peers around them cheering eyes wide and knuckles white would you stop them or give the young scraps some advice do you see a violent squabble or boys acting on natural impulses which will better equip them to defend their family and neighbours later in life the answer you give is in large part dependent on your gender so the fact that this scenario would make an increasingly large number of men upset is a sign of a collapsing civilization but nil desperandum  western civilization has the solution
mere horseplay
as an early years professional i saw education academics acknowledging the databoys need rough and tumble play for their mental and physical wellbeing but they have no way of encouraging this in institutions where boys are immediately reprimanded for making fingerpistols at each other without saying it directly they thought that the majority female teaching staff for younger age ranges were pushing our boys natural urge to fight like lioncubs underground whats more the boys were made to feel bad about themselves and their very nature
their solution they suggested that more men be encouraged to teach younger children and engage in rough play with them until the late s education was male dominated and boys spent a lot of time with male mentors but of course there has been no effort to bring back that environment instead a compromise between boys being boys and boys being fairy princesses was achievedplaying superheroes
as though female teachers are going to tone down the disapproval as the boys shoot lasers and magic at each other the treacherous political class present only feeble attempts to manage the symptoms of our societal masculinity problem like sticking some tape over the burst pipe of our hemorrhaging testosterone as cultural marxism continues to swing the pickaxe of nthwave feminism at it so its high time we took a few swings back
but first we need to teach our lads how to fight at the age of  or  viking children were taught the martial art of glima this was not just father and son playfighting boys and occasionally girls already wrestle with friends and family up to that age this was more systematic a group activity
the greeks also taught their boys how to wrestle because our other ancestors could see the big picture the hoplites for example were individualistic free men of all ages who voluntarily came together to practise combat this not only strengthened their communities but also allowed these farmers to fend off the persian empire yet today even isolated expressions of violence in computer games are questioned by sjws nevertheless all the signs are thereour boys are yearning for the same activities practised by their forefathers

at college i started a unofficial fight clubmen only this based in large part on the book and movie of the same name in which the narrators nietzschean alter ego tyler durden describes the bubbling frustration inside the everincreasing number of somethings coming together for underground fights were a generation of men raised by women naturally half the guys in my year were participating within a week but our young boys should be taught how to fight openly and without shame to avoid hidden expressions of violence and maybe even some massshootings by angry loner teens when they are young it is the perfect time to teach them
young lads have no intention of seriously injurying their friends its just good fun and produces healthier attitudes towards violence and confidence in selfdefence and the defence of ones community furthermore a recent study has shown that fighting helps to strengthen peer relationships meaning less bullying and segregation it is interesting to compare the codes of honour of ancient greek wrestling etc with those we intuit as wrestling children
no intentional hitting or kicking no gouging the eyes or biting no going for the balls thats precisely how i used to wrestle with my brothers and friends as a pup it was just obvious if someone took things too far they were ostracised from the fun at least until they calmed down and apologised if someone got hurt we stopped checked whether they were just being a pussy or needed to get themselves mended we kept calm and carried on
were a generation of men raised by women  tyler durden
the data are screaming that men havent changed especially our need to practise fighting we still have the same natural impulses but their suppression no their demonisation has made our men weak and submissive so much so many are selfdeprecating betas who believe masculinity is toxic full of white guilt and ashamed of western civilization we have everything to be proud of and need to encourage our boys fighting spirit so they grow some balls some confidence in themselves and their kin thats the spirit which has kept our enemies foreign and domestic at bay for thousands of years and will do the same to cultural marxism malevolent immigrants and anyone else who wants to have a go if we want to turn scrapping boys into men first and gentlemen second we need to organise some fights not break them up

"earlier i skewered nine dictators thugs demagogues and politicians adored by leftists despite considerable failings in policy ethics and hygiene here are six more overhyped figures revered by leftists who always get everything wrong
franklin delano roosevelt 
how the world remembers fdr led america through the great depression and wwii remembered fondly by seniors who heard his inspiring fireside chats
the ugly truth some economists argue that fdrs measures prolonged the great depression  all the new deal programs were struck down as unconstitutional except social security he got the supreme court to back off by threatening to pack the court with more members with views to his liking that restrained their judicial opinion though the constitution doesnt grant congress the power to create a federal retirement system
social security worksthough its slim pickings if its a retirees only incomeand for decades the surplus has been a cash cow offsetting congressional overspending  however the aging baby boomers who didnt have enough children might turn the cash cow into an albatross further the social security number is now a defacto universal id number a convenient database field for monitoring citizens  americas founding fathers would have been appalled at todays domestic spying  and the soviet dictators of old would have wept with envy
fdr pledged to keep the usa out of wwii  meanwhile he quietly did everything possible to antagonize japan a oncefriendly nation such as among several items freezing their assets and cutting off their oil supply when he got intelligence of the upcoming attack on pearl harbor he didnt order the base to be locked and loaded
if that wasnt bad enough so nearly a quarter million americans died in battle but at least the pivotal intervention came just in time to make the world safe for democracy right unfortunately fdr was far too friendly with the ussr giving them nearly  billion in food weaponry and other supplies about  billion adjusted for inflation
at the yalta conference fdr agreed to let uncle joe stalin take over eastern europe general patton wanted to press forward at full speed to keep as much territory as possible away from soviet tyranny but politics hampered him every step of the way until he got rubbed out  when the iron curtain rose and the cold war began winston churchill said we slaughtered the wrong pig if only roosevelt had listened to his generals
fdr wasnt a communist but many of his appointees and trusted advisers were later joseph mccarthy barely scratched the surface trying to get rid of them
walter cronkite 
how the world remembers he was a longtime cbs anchorman reporting many triumphs and tragedies a friendly face on living room tvs for decades he became everyones uncle walter according to polls he was the most trusted man in america
the ugly truth although a decent fellow in person cronkite was the archetypal bigname liberal journalist  spinning the news for decades sometimes it was rather subliminal including his signature subtle sneer most of the public then believed journalists were muckrakers and unbiased truthtellers as cronkites tagline went and thats the way it is
until cronkites late career the mainstream media had a veneer of respectabilityperhaps like warped plastic barely sticking to crumbling particleboard but a veneer nonetheless there once were only three american corporate tv networks from manhattan they were the publics information gatekeepers no other broadcast news besides shortwave radio was available baby boomer liberals might get a bit mistyeyed remembering those days today six megaconglomerates own  of the media but at least the internet lets us present our own perspectives and call out biased reporters 
if that wasnt bad enough  his biggest whopper was about the tet offensive the viet cong launched a desperate allout assault suffered very heavy losses mostly it was over within a day and ultimately the vc gained no territory however the most trusted man in america gave them a propaganda victory reporting that the vietnam war was hopeless public opinion promptly turned against the war ho chi minh shouldve given cronkite a medal an honorary vc generalship and a dozen roses
many forget that the  paris accords brought peace two years later though the shaky ford administration couldnt persuade congress to respond appropriately to a shit test by north vietnam then they invaded and saigon fell all thats a long story but public opinion from biased reporting certainly didnt help that affected americas prestige abroad along with the lives of millions of south vietnamese killed or sent to reeducation camps 
allen ginsberg 
how the world remembers he was a pioneer of the beatniks much beloved by the hippies who followed and lauded with several literary prizes some even credit him with basically starting the s counterculture singlehandedly
the ugly truth ginsberg was neurotic and a degenerate he wrote a socalled poem about his sphincter yes really but the rest isnt much better anyone considering his bathroom wall ravings as profound either is educated beyond his ability to comprehend believed the hype and didnt read it or dropped too much acid
howl his bestknown poem begins i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness a brief excerpt get some brain bleach describing these best minds
who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of capitalism
who distributed supercommunist pamphlets in union square weeping and undressing while the sirens of los alamos wailed them down and wailed down wall and the staten island ferry also wailed
who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons
who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication
who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists and screamed with joy
who blew and were blown by those human seraphim the sailors caresses of atlantic and caribbean love
who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may 
even overlooking the lunacy buggery and butthurt ginsbergs free verse is stylistically lazy back when poetry meant keats and kipling it rhymed and had meter
he was a noted critic of the usa for example
america i used to be a communist when i was a kid im not sorry
ginsberg visited several communist countries getting himself deported from some of them for immorality he abandoned his ancestral faith for buddhism and had a hare krishna phase what people believe is up to them of course but adding these two things upalong with his wretched poetryreveals a tortured soul rejecting everything one belongs to is childish rebellion for rebellions sake
granted ginsbergs popularity was greatest during the screwedup kill your parents s still what were those who promoted his crapulous drivel smoking were the literary gatekeepers pushing cultural marxism running out of talented writers
if that wasnt bad enough ginsberg joined the north american manboy love association sometimes speaking kindly on their behalf explaining in an accurately titled interviewpolitics pederasty and consciousnessto the harvard crimson 
as i get older having very specialised sexual tastes it gets harder to make out i like young boys why id have more chance at making out with younger guys if i were younger dewier dewylimbed
the media usually portrays pickup artists as reprobates and screeched about donald trumps yearsold private locker room talk but the presstitutes likewise the lefty intelligentsia fawningly praised ginsberg despite his appetite for young boys 
ted kennedy best friends forever east and west
how the world remembers he was the lion of the senate representing massachusetts from  until his death in  this champion of social justice carried on the kennedy legacyhailed as americas nobilityafter his two brothers were tragically slain
the ugly truth he was as passionate for booze and adultery as he was for social justice but the suckers kept reelecting him his lack of character sank way deeper though all the way underwater
after a night of partying on chappaquiddick island ted kennedy drove off a bridge he escaped but failed to help his passenger mary jo kopechne per one of the investigators she suffocated slowly in an air pocket for about two hours if hed ran to a nearby house for helprather than waiting nine hours to sober upshe wouldve survived he got a two month suspended sentence barely a slap on the wrist for vehicular manslaughter the judge basically said poor teddy had suffered enough what about how miss kopechne suffered theres one set of rules for the elites  and another for us shortly thereafter he tried to spindoctor it with a woe is me shtick the suckers kept reelecting him though a presidential bid was now beyond reach
as for his many legislative actions the immigration and nationality act of  was the most notorious he promised the public 
first our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually under the proposed bill the present level of immigration remains substantially the same secondly the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset contrary to the charges in some quarters the bill will not inundate america with immigrants from any one country or area or the most populated and deprived nations of africa and asia in the final analysis the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think the bill will not flood our cities with immigrants it will not upset the ethnic mix of our society it will not relax the standards of admission it will not cause american workers to lose their jobs 
the lion of the senate was lyin his fat ass off this population replacement policy threatens americas future  just as the coudenhovekalergi plan is doing in europe still the suckers kept reelecting him
if that wasnt bad enough besides giving away the country to which the constitution granted the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity  lyin ted was in cahoots with the kgb  he proposed to help his soviet pal yuri andropov with tidying up the ussrs image problem during the cold wars endgame the damning documents suggested that walter cronkite see above and barbara walters might be used for this effort conservatives often suspect liberals are soft on communism little did they know how cozy ted kennedy was in bed with comrade andropov
john lennon 
how the world remembers he was a talented musician arguably the most prominent of the beatles their story was an archetypal garage band becoming a bar band and eventually breaking out into great fame lennon produced dozens of hits that still get air play hes remembered as a wonderful man an embodiment of the s the good parts  anyway and the conscience of the world
the ugly truth despite lennons considerable talents not all his songs were excellent things slipped with the white album  revolution  really after the beatles broke up he started a solo career often featuring songs with sophomoric political poses his last album produced during his lifeafter dragging himself out of a long heroin stuporwas double fantasy  critics at first agreed that it sucked after a nut shot lennon they felt sorry for him and declared it brilliant
lennon was the archetypal leftist celebrity using fame to push politics granted everyone has a right to their opinion but being able to sing or act confers no special political expertise his song imagine is particularly telling as he put it
imagine that there was no more religion no more country no more politics is virtually the communist manifesto even though im not particularly a communist and i do not belong to any movement
being under the shadow of the berlin wall back in their bar gig days shouldve precluded sophomoric posturing like this
if that wasnt bad enough his failings are quite troubling too numerous to fully detail one item is abandoning his family the way his own father did a truly wonderful man wouldnt do that
another item was his extensive substance abuse he spent  guzzling booze his lost weekend one night a waitress refused service because he stuck a menstrual pad on his head then
lennon do you know who i am
waitress yeah youre some asshole with a kotex on his forehead
one lennon biographer asked timothy leary whod been on hundreds of acid trips what lennons extreme lsd consumption would do leary had no idea finally what kind of inner vacuum caused this highly successful musician much beloved by the public to get himself strung out on heroin
jimmy carter in this heartwarming scene jimmy carter and uncle fidel stand for the cuban national anthem in havana
how the world remembers carter is praised as a rare honest politician exemplifying christian principles and tolerance
the ugly truth the economy tanked during the carter administration doubledigit inflation and high unemployment economists are still puzzled by stagflation normally unemployment and inflation are inversely correlated at least obama gave economists another data point to study
carters commendably not corrupt but exemplified bleedinghearted liberalism despite winning the nobel peace prize for not being george w bush likewise al gore and the lightworker carter was a lackluster embarrassment he was known for tmi statements for example about his hemorrhoids and committing adultery in his heart at least clinton had the balls to do it for real he ranked lower than mr whipple on a face recognition survey the boston globe reported on one of his speeches with the headline more mush from the wimp finally journalists got something right
carters shining foreign policy moment was the camp david accords establishing peace between egypt and israel america started giving over a billion annually to each party for making peace which ironically supplies their military why the usa wasnt even a combatant aside from the uss liberty incident which certainly shouldnt inspire american tribute money taxpayers still fund this absurd protection racket
worse he badly bungled the iran hostage crisis one iranian official later stated they wouldve released the hostages if the usa had threatened force in the beginning yep carter failed irans shit test consequentially the usa lost tons of international prestige and the ordeal of the hostages dragged on unnecessarily
if that wasnt bad enough carter is often a little too cordial with notorious dictators  worse clinton trusted him to represent the usa during disarmament talks with north korea they gave him the potemkin village show he bought it hook line and sinker yet again carter was played for a chumpthe usa opened its wallet and gave north korea aid and they pinkyswore to stop their nuclear program now the norks have nukessurprise awesome job mister nice guy

bill still  good morning im still reporting on chan 
if truepundit is right again then there are movements of fbi agents tonight that suggest a massive raid happening tomorrow in the dc metro area that may involve arrests and seizure of evidence in the clinton foundation investigation 
i think i can hear the sound of thousands of computers being scrubbed by bleachbit from leesburg virginia to bowie maryland when i walk outside and if so then tomorrow a mighty blow for freedom will be struck as the first step towards the restoration of the rule of law is taken 
but first this letter from anonymous writing on chan making some interesting predictions 
first of all what is chan 
see also sr   huma abedin flipped in nypd slimy sex probe  crooked hillary may be involved 
it is a message board that is designed from the ground up to be totally anonymous users dont even have to pick a username posts are time sensitive  less time for rrated discussion threads  more time for g or pg rated ones so the reliability of the comments can only be judged by knowledge of the context surrounding the comments 
i did a story on chan on aug   still report   since i thought it was true i ran the story then now it no longer seems a bit flaky because much of it has panned out 
the particular chan thread that pertained to whether or not hillary clinton would not be recommended for indictment by fbi director jim comey was announced by an anonymous fbi analyst 
now management of the thread has apparently been taken over by anonymous the previous author may have met his fate at the hands of the conspirators attempting to steal the american election what follows is the message dated nov    
over the next few days many new documents will be released the contents of these documents will contain evidence of perhaps the largest coverup in american history 
before this happens we would like to explain ourselves and answer a few questions you may have 
until this month wikileaks and anonymous have worked together building an efficient detailed comprehensive set of documents that would be responsible for the incarceration of hillary clinton bill clinton and  individuals ranging from the dnc fbi cia and clinton foundation 
these documents will show without a doubt the evidence of treason obstruction of justice election fraud manipulation and bribery 
this was intended to be the october surprise but before the release of these documents we were contacted by a member of the fbi as well as another from the cia and a week later by the nypd all with information pertaining to something much darker than even we imagine due to the nature of these leaks we all work together as efficiently as possible to ensure two objectives  that all necessary information would be given to the public in an organized searchable manageable way  those who provided us with this information would be able to find safety before these releases were made this concern wasnt without warrant 
the new leaks being released this week will provide documents in the form of emails pictures and videos within these will be evidence of bill clinton as well as at least six other government officials taking part in sexual acts with minors as well as evidence of human trafficking that also included minors we believe these pictures and videos were taken for the purpose of political manipulation in order to make sure all participants followed through on a previously agreed agenda 
these documents were given to us by an american government official when he had come to learn that this crime had been covered up by hillary and her staff through methods including bribery and blackmail he also told us that due to the restricted access of these documents they would soon know he was the one who released them to us we were trying to make arrangements for him to exit the country safely but he was killed before those arrangements could be carried out

"leave a reply maureen moss  not a typical newsletter from me these are words that flowed forth this morning 
clearly the week ahead for the united states and those across the world will be one of the most significant in history the presidential election is historic in and of itself though the weeks to follow may prove to be more so nothing is as it appears to be 
we are in the beginning times of an entirely new civilization as was humanity some  years ago everything not harmonized with this new civilization will be dismantled not sometime in the future in the weeks directly in front of us 
hundreds of thousands of years and billions of people will be shaped by who we become individually and then collectively and how this earth is restructured by the events unfolding now 
we must trust we are being brought into harmony under the impulse of one system of operation 
long knowing that a new humanity and new global reality would be born in this our lifetime certainly we had little idea of how that would occur 
not all that long ago we came to know the responsibility we personally held to lift and stabilize our consciousness open wide our hearts and free ourselves from the captivity of a deceptive fearful lower nature having multiple realities 
certainly we started becoming aware of our desire to know ourselves authentically thus beginning the journey to return to a singular loving nature no longer conflicted by dual pillars of truth nor at odds or war with ourselves 
all this in divine right time and in preparation for a new reality to be born on earth it had to begin within ourselves 
certainly not as instinctively was how an entire distorted external reality politically socially economically and more operating in reverse truth riddled with deception lies and manipulation would come to find its true nature 
few would have considered how much could potentially come to light under the glare of so much darkness or that it would come through a presidential election far from over on election day regardless of the seeming winnerin the united states of america 
this election is a seismic evolutionary event  
in this week ahead and those to follow through the flurry and activity of the end times and the beginnings as you witness the distorted psychology of the human system exposed and broken down from every angle breathe stay in your center and with an open heart open mind and love be in observance of this most profound display of activity on behalf of humanities evolution and that of the earth

steve taylor phd  from the standpoint of ordinary consciousness separateness seems to be a basic part of the human condition most human beings experience themselves as egos trapped inside their own mindspace observing a world which seems to be out there on the other side of their skulls as a result the normal human state is one of aloneness were always onlookers rather than participants we can communicate with other people by speaking writing or gesturing but they will never be able to truly know us or to share our thoughts and feelings our inner being will always be sealed off from them 
egoseparation also creates a sense of incompleteness because were separate from the world were like fragments which have broken off from the whole and so feel a sense of insufficiency there s a kind of hole inside us which we spend most of our lives trying to fill but very rarely manage to like cats who were taken away from their mother at birth and who are always hankering for affection and attention to try to compensate for a sense of lack bornagain christians mean something close to this when they say that there is a godshaped hole inside us although in my view traditional religion cant fill the hole either only provide the same ultimately incomplete consolation as wealth or success 
as a result of this aloneness and incompleteness we dont feel completely at home in the world were not completely rooted here and so feel somehow adrift as if we dont fully belong like people who have travelled around the world so much that they no longer feel at home anywhere whereas traditional indigenous peoples seem to perceive the world as a benign and benevolent place to us it seems indifferent and even vaguely malevolent 
in addition our egoisolation generates a basic sense of insecurity and insignificance our own ego is so tiny and so flimsy in the face of the enormous world out there  like a tiny wooden beach shack at the edge of a vast ocean we feel dwarfed by the sheer weight of the phenomena and events taking place out there  how can we possibly have any significance in relation to them how can this fragile entity inside our heads stand up to the might of the world the wider effects of separateness 
however the effects of this separateness reach far beyond the individual in fact i would go so far as to say that the sense of separateness is the root cause of the constant conflict warfare and oppression which have blighted human history the human sense of incompleteness generates a craving for possessions power and status as a way of trying to complete ourselves and compensate for our inner discord we try to complete ourselves  and make ourselves significant  by gaining power over other people or by collecting wealth and possessions 
this desire for wealth and power is the root cause of warfare and oppression too coupled with the reduced empathy which separateness causes the separate self walls us off from other human beings makes it difficult for us to feel with them and to experience the world from their perspective this makes it possible for us to be violent and cruel to other people since we cant sense the suffering we cause them so we oppress and exploit them in the service of our own desires oppress women members of lower classes or castes different races so that we can gain more power status and wealth 
the sense of separateness is also the root cause of our abuse of the environment it means that we experience a sense of otherness to nature and that we cant sense its aliveness and as a result we dont feel any qualms about exploiting and abusing it why separateness 
i wouldnt exactly say that separateness is an illusion as many nonduality teachers would not an illusion but an aberration  something which exists but shouldnt children dont experience separateness they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world this is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful because the child feels connected to everything around them in a participatory flow with all experience with no in here or out there 
there are also many other peoples in the world who even as adults dont exist in a state of separateness most of the world s indigenous peoples dont see themselves as separate to their environment they feel a strong sense of connection to nature an awareness that they are a part of the web of creation and one which is no more important than any other 
as tim ingold writes of the batek negritos of malaysia for example they see themselves as involved in an intimate relationship of interdependence with the plants animals and hala spirits including the deities which inhabit their world or as the cherokee indian scholar rebecca adamson points out for indigenous peoples the environment is perceived as a sensate conscious entity suffused with spiritual powers through which the human understanding is only realised in perfect humility before the sacred whole the hopi use the term novoitti for the concept of living in harmony with nature while the tlingit also of north america call it shogan 
the anthropologist lucien levybruhl believed that essential characteristic of native peoples was that the limits of their individuality are variable and illdefined he noted that rather than existing as selfsufficient individual entities indigenous peoples sense of identity was bound up with their community and their land he cites reports of native peoples who used the word i when speaking of their group and others who see their land as an extension of their self so that being forced away from their land would be tantamount to death this is why native peoples are often prepared to commit suicide rather than leave their lands 
the naming practices of certain peoples suggest this too for us a name is a permanent label which defines our individuality and autonomy but australian aborigines for example do not have fixed names which they keep throughout their lives their names regularly change and include those of other members of their tribe other native peoples use tekonyms terms which describe the relationship between two people instead of personal or kinship names 
the sense of separateness seems to be a quirk of our psychological development for us it slowly develops as we move into adolescence becoming firmly established in our late teens the ego develops as a structure creating a sense of innerness and walling us off 
witness the massive change which occurs when a child enters adolescence especially with boys the freshness and joy of childhood gives way to dullness and confusion after being a part of the glorious flow of experience were suddenly outside the world alone inside our own mental space this is why adolescents have such a strong need for belonging 
their new sense of separation makes them feel so vulnerable that they need to reinforce their identity by being a part of groups or gangs or by following fashions more bleakly this is also why most murders are committed by young men in response to perceived slights or insults with their new fragile sense of identity young men are liable to take offence at any kind of trivial affront making them feel belittled and creating an instant desire to take revenge and regain their lost status 
i remember this transition clearly from my own adolescence after a carefree childhood i suddenly felt locked inside myself alone with thoughts and feelings which no one else would ever be able to experience along with that i felt an acute selfconsciousness i was aware of every movement i made and every word i spoke so that i couldnt do anything naturally anymore i felt exposed when i walked down the street aware that people could have been looking at me from their windows 
as they grow into adulthood most people deal with the fragility and vulnerability of the self by taking on roles and attachments they take on the roles of their jobs attach themselves to certain beliefs strengthening their identity with labels such as socialists atheists or muslims or attach themselves to ambitions to knowledge theyve accumulated to their selfimage as important or powerful people or emotionally attach themselves to other people these roles and attachments become the scaffolding of the ego propping it up and at the same time they reinforce separation making the individual walled off awakening from the sleep of separateness 
however no matter how far into separateness we fall in a sense its never more than superficial no matter how strong the ego becomes its never more than a construct everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades and we become part of the unity again these are what i refer to as awakening experiences they frequently occur when were walking amongst natural surroundings when were dancing or running during or after sex listening to or playing music in these situations the normal chattering of the ego which is the normal fuel of the ego maintaining it as a structure becomes quiet leading to a softening of its boundaries separateness dissolves and were afloat on the ocean of being again immersed in the glorious isness and aliveness of the world 
tellingly in these moments there is always an identity shift we feel that weve become someone else a deeper more grounded self which seems more authentically you the egoself we identified with before seems like an imposter a limited and shallow trickster who somehow deluded us into thinking it was our identity 
there are also many cases of extreme loss or intense turmoil when all of the egos building blocks its roles and attachments are broken away a person might be diagnosed with cancer and told they only have a few months left to live an alcoholic might reach rock bottom and be on the point of suicide a person might become seriously disabled through injury or illness or they might suffer from the trauma of bereavement depression the destruction of hopes and beliefs and so on in most cases these forms of loss simply bring sadness and suffering but for a minority of individuals they can trigger a spiritual awakening with all its scaffolding broken down the normal egoself dissolves away and our deeper truer self emerges in its place like a butterfly from a caterpillar the person feels reborn like a different person inhabiting the same body with a new sense of meaning and connection 
in all of these experiences there is a sense of coming home back to our original oneness the harmony which both as an individual and as a species we fell away from it was always there it is always here its just that our separate selves deluded us into thinking we were asleep

according to numerous reports and stories that have been published through the years among the many alleged secrets the vatican has there is a device called the chronovisor the device enables its user to observe future as well as past events many believe this device is one of the greatest guarded secrets humanity has ever had 
some even believe it is a crucial tool which has allowed the vatican to preserve its influence and power through the years 
ever since h g wells composed his novel the time machine many people have been left fascinated by the idea of time travel even theoretical physics dreams of the possibility of making it work one day everything related to time travel today is related to science fiction or so it seems at least interestingly on may   an italian newspaper shocked the world when they published an article with a provoking headline a machine that photographs the past has finally been invented  
the news article indicated that dozens of scientists created an artifact that allowed them to photograph the past and even witness important historical accounts directly connected with jesus christ 
the alleged device which according to many is nothing more than science fiction was built in the s by a team of scientists led by father pellegrino maria ernetti an italian physicist who eventually became a priest 
it is believed that the team received important help from nobel laureate enrico fermi and famous rocket scientist wernher von braun 
the chronovisor is a relatively small object that is equipped with a number of antennas and is composed entirely of precious alloys cathode tubes some dials and levers reports by father ernetti suggest that whoever uses the device is able to capture and record specific locations important events and follow in history noteworthy individuals according to father ernetti he had observed among other historical events christs crucifixion and photographed it as well view image the image to the left is the one obtained using the chronovisor on the right is a similar image located in a church in perugia 
it is even said that under the perfect conditions the device offers its user the ability to foresee what was going to happen in the near future 
however father ernetti remained secretive and stated he was not at liberty to reveal further details about the chronovisor 
father ernetti did however reveal that the chronovisor worked by processing residual electromagnetic radiation left over by numerous processes 
according to numerous reports father ernetti used the chronovisor to witness important historical events with the most notable being the crucifixion of christ 
however father ernetti revealed that thanks to this invention had managed to witness the destruction of sodom and gomorrah and other major historical events such as the founding of rome in  bc also thanks to the chronovisor father ernetti was able to recompose the missing work thyestes  written by ennio quinto and represented in rome in  ac in its original version and the original text of the the two stone tablets written by god exodus  which were given to moses on mount sinai apart from witnessing the likes of napoleon roman philosopher cicero and other great and momentous historical and biblical episodes 
french priest franÃ§ois charles antoine brune was one of the first to hear about the chronovisor according to father franÃ§ois he met father ernetti in the s when the two were traveling across the grand canal of venice as the two were experts in ancient languages they began to talk about the bible and its interpretation through the years supposedly these are the blueprints of the chronoviso r image 
father brune that was very intrigued when the father ernetti revealed that there was a machine that could answer all questions related to the bible 
when father franÃ§ois asked about the machine father ernetti described the chronovisor saying that it was device that functioned just like a tv but instead of receiving transmissions from local stations the chronovisor was able to tune into the past and allow the viewer to see and hear events that had occurred centuries before 
ernetti told brune that the machine worked by detecting images and sounds that humanity had created which were floating in space 
it is said that this intriguing device and the project behind it were canceled by the vatican but not destroyed some believe the chronovisor is located somewhere in the vatican hidden in one of the many chambers hidden away from society 
however there are other versions that suggest that father ernetti and his team decided to voluntarily dismantle the device because since it could tune anywhere and anytime in the past if it were to fall into the wrong hands it could create the scariest dictatorship the world has ever seen 
interestingly before father ernetti died in april  he wrote a letter in which he insisted that the device was real and was not a hoax as many believed 
father ernetti claimed that the alleged photograph the chronovisor had captured of jesus christ on the cross showing the sorrowful face of a bearded man gazing towards the heavens was real even though some critics argue that the image was a reproduction of a statue of jesus located in a church in perugia 
critics also claim that the alleged text the device managed to observe of thyestes included latin words that did not exist at the time it was made 
in  father ernetti also said that pope pius xii forbade us to do disclose any details about this device because the machine was very dangerous it can restrain the freedom of man 
however in  the vatican issued a decree in which it warned that anyone using an instrument of such characteristics would be excommunicated according to many this was an unnecessary warning since according to them the chronovisor never existed so why issue a warning if it was just another hoax 
what do you think about the story behind the chronovisor do you think it is another top secret object kept away from society by the vatican sf source rise earth",Fake

leave a reply aa michael  when you are attuned to the midthdimensional frequencies of light you relinquish the idea of being human as you have known it in the past it is a time of the emergence of your soul consciousness as you allow it to become the reigning influence within your life this means you begin to listen to the wisdom of your body elemental and the signals it sends as to what is appropriate for your physical and emotional wellbeing your dna and the cells of your body begin to integrate the higher frequencies of light and gradually you begin to vibrate and attune to the refined energy of the new age this period of the transformation process could be likened to a death of your old selfconsciousness which is really the process of removing the veils of illusion as you integrate each new level of your oversoulhigher self you absorb the wisdom and illumination of that facet of your vaster being you are in the process of shedding the multiple layers of density which you have absorbed within your auric field down through the many ages of earthly experience the saying the light shall set you free is a true statement for the light is dissolving the layers upon layers of negativity that you have carried for such a very long time you begin to function within an auric field of refined light of your own creation as you turn inward and learn to stay focused and centered within your sacred heart in the power of the now moment over time you as light transformers begin to draw forth and integrate the maximum amount of adamantine particles of creator light and you then consciously radiate forth the remainder out to humanity and to the world when you achieve a certain level of harmony within you open the physical body gateways or portals to the higher dimensions the ascension chakra or the medulla oblongata and the vagus nerve at the base of the skull and also the back portal of your sacred heart and your sacred mind these are major steps in the ascension process when this process is complete you are well on your way to gaining access to the first sublevel of the fifth dimension where your entrylevel sacred triad is waiting to welcome you the adameve kadmon body is your original individualized seed atom godself in a fully conscious light body form created by the elohim lords of lightbuilders of as the archetype of humanity the adam kadmon embodies the original complete divine and spiritual nature of manwoman it is not the same as your personal oversoul body of light which is itself evolving towards divine consciousness your higher selves your spiritualoversoul body and your sacred triads are refracted facets of your god self your original light body the kadmon light body has the ability to take on any form necessary to create and experience all forms of creation in your fathermother gods plan for this universe the adameve kadmon is a spiritualphysical creation which incarnates in the planetary worlds during all cycles of divine creation physical body  in the beginning awakening process there is a desire to turn inward and to listen to the inner wisdom of the soul this soul awareness includes your body elemental the memory seed atom which contains the perfect blueprint for your original adameve kadmon light form emotional body  first you become aware that your emotions control you through your wants needs and desires which in the long run do not bring you a sense of happiness or satisfaction you begin to turn inward and to question your life choices asking awhat have been the results of your actions you begin to seek answers for the pain and dissatisfaction in your life the voice of your superconscious mind becomes stronger as you gradually take heed and follow your souls guidance as you become comfortable and begin to rely on this voice of higher wisdom the egodesire body gradually relinquishes control and the soulself becomes the director and guiding influence in your life you begin to align your will with the will of your higher self for you have gradually learned to trust the inspirational and intuitive thoughts from your sacred mind eventually you begin to view all interactive events in your life from a higher vantage point you develop emotional detachment through a more refined view of human interactions having experienced most of the important tests of the emotions you develop a better understanding of the human emotional nature again you learn to go with the flow and you view your tests and challenges as gifts and opportunities for growth you have learned to make peace with the past and to script your future as you endeavor to live and focus on the now moment gradually over time the vibrational patterns of the emotional body are lifted above the magnetic pull of the physical realm the mental body  you begin to realize the limitations of your subconscious and conscious minds and you see how rigid limited and stuck you have been in the mass consciousness belief structure you willingly begin a selfanalysis process whereby you reevaluate your attitudes judgment and programmed concepts you begin to feel a burning desire to expand your knowledge beyond your physical reality as you seek to learn why you are here on earth and the greater meaning of life your instinctive mind gives way to your higher intellectual mind and gradually you gain access to

"leave a reply mike adams  under fbi head james comey who has deliberately and clearly conspired to cover up the enormous number of crimes committed by hillary clinton and her closest staffers the fbis investigation of additional emails is now concluded we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in july with respect to secretary clinton comey announced today 
with this decision james comey essentially announces that the tyranny of criminal government in washington is now complete  
the rule of law has just been declared null and void by the head of the fbi no sufficiently powerful person in washington will ever be held accountable for their crimes including crimes of treason against the nation bribery corruption destruction of evidence and selling government influence 
unless something reverses very quickly the fbi has now cemented its position as nothing more than a corrupt branch of a totalitarian criminal regime that has seized power in washington to protect the criminal class of political elitists who rule over the nation as lawless tyrants 
now its up to rogue fbi agents or the nypd to go public with the evidence they have and expose the horrifying truth about what the clintons really are pedophilia and all if that fails my analysis says we may see a rapid ramping up of real talk of open revolt  perhaps even leading to an armed citizens march on washington to depose the criminal regime in power as ive pointed out before that effort would only require a few thousand armed citizens to achieve the occupation of key government buildings and the overthrow of the criminals in power sadly it would also involve tremendous bloodshed and loss of life lets hope it doesnt come to that

"arent you surprised that hillary and the presstitutes havent blamed putin for fbi director comeys reopening of the hillary email case but the presstitutes have done the next best thing for hillary they have made comey the issue not hillary
according to us senator harry reid and the presstitutes we dont need to worry about hillarys crimes after all she is only a political woman feathering her nest just as political men have done for ages why all this misogynist talk about hillary the presstitutes cry is that comeys alleged crime is far more important this womanhating republican violated the hatch act by telling congress that the investigation he said was closed is now reopened a very strange interpretation of the hatch act during an election it is ok to announce that a candidate for president is cleared but it is not ok to say that a candidate is under investigation
in july  comey violated the hatch act when he on orders from the corrupt obama attorney general announced hillary clean in so doing comey used the prestige of federal clearance of hillarys violation of national security protocols to boost her standing in the election polls
actually hillarys standing in the polls is based on the pollsters overweighting hillary supporters in the polls it is easy to produce a favorite if you overweight their supporters in the poll questions if you look at the crowds attending the two candidates public appearances it is clear that the american people prefer donald trump who is opposed to war with russia and china war with nuclear powers is the big issue of the election
hillarys problem has the ruling american oligarchy for which hillary is the total servant concerned what are they going to do about trump if he wins will his fate be the same as john f kennedy robert kennedy martin luther king george wallace time will tell or will a hotel maid appear at the last minute in the way that the oligarchy got rid of dominique strausskahn
all of the american and western feminists progressives and leftwing remnant fell for the obvious frameup of strausskahn after strausskahn was blocked from the presidency of france and resigned as director of the imf the new york authorities had to drop all charges against strausskahn but washington succeeded in removing strausskahn as a challenge to its french vassal sarkozy
this is how the american oligarchy destroys those it suspects might not serve its interests the corrupt selfserving oligarchy makes sure that it owns the government and the media the think tanks and increasingly all of the major universities and of course through the presstitutes americans minds
the oligarchs are now hardpressed to rescue hillary as us president so lets see if the oligarchs can once again deceive the american people
while we wait lets concern ourselves with another important issue the clinton crime syndicate in the closing years of the th century allowed a small handful of megacorporations to consolidate the us media in a few hands this vast increase in the power of the oligarchy was accomplished despite us antitrust law the media mergers destroyed the american tradition of a dispersed and independent media
but really what does federal law mean to the one percent nothing whatsoever the one percents power makes them immune to law hillarys crimes might cost her the election but she wont go to jail
not content with  control of the us media the oligarchy wants more concentration and more control looks like they will be getting it thanks to the corrupt us government the federal trade commission is supposed to enforce us antitrust law instead the federal agency routinely violates us antitrust law by permitting monopoly concentrations of business interests
because of the failure of the federal government to enforce federal law we now have banks too big to fail unregulated internet monopoly and the evisceration of a dispersed and independent media
not so long ago there was a field of economics known as antitrust phd candidates specialized in and wrote dissertations about public control of monopoly power i assume that this field of economics like the america of my youth no longer exists
in the article below rahul manchanda explains that yet again another huge media conglomerate is being swallowed and acquired by another huge media conglomerate to create another gargantuan media outlet in another consolidation of the enormous power money wealth intimidation conspiracy and control that eviscerates the us constitution and the first amendment

citis chief political analyst tina fordham has had a busy month 
at the start of october  when trumps victory odds were in the gutter and a clinton presidency had been priced in  in a hotly debated statement she suggested that the establishment may be approaching the us presidential completely incorrectly this is an unusual juncture but we keep looking at it through the same kinds of lenses what if its all wrong because society technology opinion polling methods and everything else dont capture marginalized voters in the way they might once have 
according to fordham the us presidential race felt more like an election in a developing nation where public distrust in government is high and conspiracy theories are rife markets seem unaware how much that low trust raises the risk of an antiestablishment vote fordham has focused on the gallup world poll on public health which analyzes two decades worth of health records of trump supporters the numbers show a correlation between the increase in the number of people going through difficult times  as measured by suicide rates depression mental illness and drug addiction  and the rise in trumps popularity fordham said 
this is the kind of thing that investors just dont normally run into but it provides another useful way to think about things because income inequality is necessary but not sufficient she said there is something more subtle going on about public expectations and exhaustion and a sense of corruption elite abuse of power and lack of control 
her conclusion was troubling for clinton fans  im getting this brexity feeling and i know other investors are as well she said the thinking is i didnt expect brexit so i better assume trump is going to win that element of investor psychology is at play here 
she followed up on monday  when she predicted that the fbis friday announcement could have a meaningful impact on the presidential race and cautioned that this may not be the end of it we continue to emphasize the potential for more black swan events emerging making things more complicated for forecasters and pollsters 
today in her latest media appearance fordham has penned an oped for the ft looking at the postelection landscape and warning that  investors face political risk whoever wins in the us election  
she first analyzes if a a clinton victory will mean business as usual for america and the global order and responds  not so fast 
investors should brace themselves for the new form of advanced economy political risk what ever the outcome of the us presidential election 
first any market relief from a victory for mrs clinton over donald trump her republican opponent will almost certainly be followed by the realization that a divided congress will mean a return to gridlock and brinkmanship over the debt ceiling with little prospect for reform 
more broadly following the vote in the uk to leave the eu the rise of mr trump and according to a yougov study authoritarian populism politics in advanced economies are having what might be termed an emerging markets moment vox populi risk a concept i formulated in  after a wave of protests coups and the rise of nonmainstream political parties has become a global phenomenon 
she then notes that the economic and market implications of advanced economy political risks are more likely to become systemically significant than their emerging markets counterparts according to the international monetary funds recently published world economic outlook political risk in the advanced economies has become the biggest threat to global growth 
specifically she envisages the trump campaign 
from threats to jail opponents on corruption charges to the proliferation of conspiracy theories the trump campaign and its supporters have borrowed heavily from the em political playbook sowing doubts not only about his opponents suitability for office but also about us political institutions a majority of republicans now say they believe the election will be rigged according to data from pew research center despite the lack of any precedent in us election history for such claims 
reverting to her notion that the us election looks a lot like that of a developing nation she notes that  what links this advanced economy political risk with its em cousin is low trust in institutions and elites  political and business elites expertsand the media it is trust plus belief in the future not growth alone that immunizes the body politic against the populist virus the collapse of trust is also evident in the sheer number of outright lies the factchecking website politifact has tracked during the campaign if everything is bogus than anything goes  
there are also the market implications 
the reaction of financial markets may be the starkest illustration of this change in trend according to the brookings institution the effect of mr trumps candidacy has been to give rise to price movements suggesting that a trump victory would reduce the value of the sp  and lead to a  per cent decline in the mexican peso as well as pricing in future volatility 
however fordhams punchline has little to do with a trump victory but rather the consequences of another clinton presidency 
mr trump may be heading for defeat but the prevalence of low trust identity politics and demographic divides across the developed world suggests that he will not be the last nonmainstream candidate to come close to power  this constellation of risks will be in evidence before elections next year in germany france and the netherlands and will have a significant impact on brexit negotiations moreover a clinton presidency is highly likely to be marked by nearcontinuous investigations as well as the risk of impeachment 
if citi is right the preelection circus and endless drama and theatrics is just the beginning of what is about to be unleashed a world in which the political realities of dm and em worlds will converge the new normal in advanced economies looks a lot like the emerging markets old normal but with considerably higher stakes for the global economy we encourage you to share and republish our reports analyses breaking news and videos  click for details

"with the media gripped by accusatory speculation regarding the identity of the source behind the wikileaks leak of hacked podesta and dnc emails much of it focused on russia a new theory has emerged from craig murray the former british ambassador to uzbekistan who tells sputnik a russian media outlet that the source of the leaks are not russian hackers but a washington insider
the source of these emails and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the sam adams whistleblower award in washington the source of these emails comes from within official circles in washington dc you should look to washington not to moscow 

asked about whether or not wikileaks have ever published information at the behest of moscow murray said that wikileaks has never published any material received from the russian government or from any proxy of the russian government its simply a completely untrue claim designed to divert attention from the content of the material
while blasted by washington first by republicans several years ago and most recently by democrats the wikileaks revelations have often been hailed as a champion of accountability
i think whistleblowers have become extremely important in the west because the propaganda model  as chomsky puts it  has been reinforced to the extent that people dont get any true information out of the media at all its worth saying that julian assange and wikileaks are publishers they publish what whistleblowers leak to them mr murrary told sputnik
yet whistleblowers in the us continue to be subject to lengthy prison sentences a key example is chelsea manning who was sentenced on august   to a thirty five year sentence for providing wikileaks with sensitive military and diplomatic documents highlighting among other things us military conduct in iraq murray also mentions the case of john kiriakou a former investigator of international terrorism with the cia who turned whistleblower
the people who did the torture have suffered no comeback at all adds mr murray
taking a step back and discussing the risk of geopolitical escalation between russia and the us murray told sputnik that there is no chance whatsoever that russia is going to ever attack the united states that simply isnt going to happen
just as russia is not going to attack the united kingdom there never has been a chance that russia would ever attack either of these two countries but of course the narrative is all to do with power and funneling huge amounts of american taxpayer money into the defense industry and the security industry and these people are both from the class that benefits
its an extremely dangerous game says mr murray and it feeds into a foreign policy that is completely mad
in syria  and i should say im no fan of the assad regime at all  but the idea that backing assorted groups of jihadists to tear the country apart is a better solution is crazy and its especially crazy when weve already messed up iraq afghanistan and now were doing exactly the same thing again and you can see it doesnt work it only works in terms of promoting continued instability and continued spending for the military and the security services
finally murray also believes that the public cant get clear analysis of these issues from mainstream media because they are part of the same moneypower nexus

"in an excerpt of a john pilger special interview julian assange says that emails released by wikileaks show that hillary clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which us allies are supporting isis and that donald trump will not be allowed into the oval office
assange explains that the same financial interests funding isis are funding clinton he references a  email from john podesta to clinton in which we find the following
while this militaryparamilitary operation is moving forward we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of qatar and saudi arabia which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil and other radical sunni groups in the region

i think this is the most significant email in the whole collection said assange all serious analysts know and even the us government has agreed that some saudi figures have been supporting isis and funding isis but the dodge has always been that it is some rogue princes using their oil money to do whatever they like but actually the government disapproves but that email says that it is the government of saudi arabia and the government of qatar that have been funding isis
pilger asked assange about the possibility that trump would steal the election with the help of russia as many in the democratic party claim
assange thinks that this is highly unlikely but not because he is unpopular my analysis is that trump would not be permitted to win why do i say that because he has had every establishment off his side trump does not have one establishment maybe with the exception of the evangelicals if you can call them establishment he explained
assange says that hillary is the establishment pick banks intelligence arms companies foreign money etc are all united behind hillary clinton and the media as well media owners and the journalists themselves delivered by the daily sheeple

"after this october surprise donald trump only has one option left expose the clinton crimes michael on television democrats are now calling for a revolution in the streets and i believe that they are quite serious by michael snyder on november th  
the surprise victory by donald trump on november th has spawned a series of violent protests and riots all over the nation as stunned leftists continue to throw the largest postelection temper tantrum in us history protesters in large cities all across america have been disrupting public transportation looting stores hurling objects at the police and burning trump in effigy there have even been shootings at antitrump rallies in seattle and in portland  hundreds of protesters have been arrested so far and organizers are promising that this is only just the beginning meanwhile large numbers of enraged leftists are physically threatening trump on twitter  and some are even calling for a violent revolution sadly i believe that they are quite serious about this 
even some big celebrity names are starting to use the word revolution in messages to their followers on twitter katy perry has ominously warned that  the revolution is coming  and comedian sarah silverman has boldly declared that  trump gets a chance to hear us or else we r them if he fails revolution in the streets  
of course other leftists are seeking less violent ways to oppose trump there is a major push to use the electoral college to block a trump presidency if that fails there are many hoping to immediately impeach trump once he takes office and other activists such as former labor secretary robert reich are calling for a new third party if their planned postelection takeover of the democratic party is not successful 
but for many on the radical left the time for patience is over the not my president movement is taking off like a rocket and one survey found that only  percent of all clinton supporters consider trumps victory to be legitimate a protest near trump tower in new york city on saturday drew approximately  people and usa today reported that the antitrump protest in portland oregon on saturday night rapidly  devolved into a riot  
it is becoming clear that these protests are not going away any time soon and some are even beginning to refer to this movement as the purple revolution  
no sooner had trump been declared the  th president of the united states sorosfunded political operations launched their activities to disrupt trump during obamas lameduck period and thereafter the swiftness of the purple revolution is reminiscent of the speed at which protesters hit the streets of kiev the ukrainian capital in two orange revolutions sponsored by soros one in  and the other ten years later in  
as the clintons were embracing purple in new york street demonstrations some violent all coordinated by the sorosfunded moveonorg and black lives matter broke out in new york los angeles chicago oakland nashville cleveland washington austin seattle philadelphia richmond st paul kansas city omaha san francisco and some  other cities across the united states 
so could we actually see a violent revolution on the streets of america 
is the radical left really so horrified by the prospect of a trump presidency that they would actually be willing to engage in a prolonged campaign of chaos violence and physical intimidation 
well the oath keepers are so concerned about what this movement could become that they have initiated an intelligence gathering operation that they are calling operation hypo  
clearly as oath keepers we cannot simply sit around and watch while the enemies of liberty work to use violence to initiate a communist revolution in our country as a result of the intelligence being provided by our operation sabot operatives we have initiated operation hypo we have allowed our personnel to burrow deep inside these protest organizations to collect information regarding tactics motivations schedules and logistics 
we had operatives at the planning meetings for the protests that occurred last evening in baltimore md and philadelphia pa  our operatives have also penetrated numerous other planning organizations in cities across the country for opsec reasons the precise list of cities we are operating in will not be publicly disclosed 
and one thing that we already know is that the radical left is hoping to organize the largest political protest in united states history in washington dc on inauguration day i will be writing about this later today on the most important news  
the election of donald trump has been the single most galvanizing event for the radical left that we have seen in decades one of the early leaders of the not my president movement is filmmaker michael moore and the following are three of his key action points which he feels must be implemented immediately  
 must quickly and decisively form an opposition movement the likes of which hasnt been seen since the s i will do my part to help lead this as im sure many others bernie elizabeth warren moveon the hiphop community dfa etc will too the core of this opposition force will be fueled by young people who as with occupy wall street and black lives matter dont tolerate bs and are relentless in their resistance to authority they have no interest in compromising with racists and misogynists  prepare to impeach trump just as the republicans were already planning to do with president hillary from day one we must organize the apparatus that will bring charges against him when he violates his oath and breaks the law  and then we must remove him from office  must commit right now to a vigorous fight including civil disobedience if necessarywhich will block any and all donald trump supreme court nominees who do not meet our approval we demand the democrats in the senate aggressively filibuster any nominees who support citizens united or who oppose the rights of women immigrants and the poor this is nonnegotiable 
but of course other liberals are still in the shock and disbelief stage as i have stated before americans were more emotionally invested in this election than they had been in any election in decades and the aftermath has not been pretty 
this has been particularly true on college campuses all over the nation according to the new york post  college administrators have been going to extraordinary lengths to soothe the deep emotional pain that many of their students are experiencing ?the university of michigan offered its traumatized students coloring books and playdoh to calm them are its students in college or kindergarten ?the university of kansas reminded its stressedout kids that therapy dogs a regular campus feature were available ?cornell university an ivy league school held a campuswide cryin with officials handing out tissues and hot chocolate ?tufts university offered its devastated students arts and crafts sessions ok not kindergarten  more like summer camp ?at campuses from elite yale to connecticut to iowa and beyond professors canceled classes andor exams  either because students asked or because instructors were too distraught to teach 
and it is also being reported that suicide hotlines are ringing off the hook all over the nation 
we have never seen anything like this ever before and i have a feeling that this not my president movement is going to absolutely dwarf the occupy wall street and black lives matter movements and considering the very high levels of anger frustration and pain that these radical leftists are feeling it is easy to see how this movement could become very violent 
many patriots conservatives and christians were hoping that donald trump could bring america together and lead us into a new era of peace and prosperity but the radical left already hates trump more than any president that has ever come before him 
it isnt going to take much to push the radical left over the edge and if that happens we could see endless chaos violence and civil unrest for the next four years",Fake
"the election of donald trump is already having an enormous impact on the economy   th  
  sent shockwaves through the us economy and the us financial system since november th the dow has hit a brand new alltime record high  the us dollar has strengthened greatly and bank stocks are way up but not all of the economic news is good news unlike stocks bonds have reacted very negatively to trumps election victory the past week has been an absolute bloodbath for bond traders and as you will see below this is going to have dramatic implications for all us consumers moving forward 
over just a two day period more than a trillion dollars was wiped out as bond yields spiked all over the globe as cnn has noted  this type of violent reaction in the bond market has only happened three other times within the past ten years 
the rate on year treasury notes has surged to  from  before the election last weeks spike in treasury rates was so big that it had only happened three times before in the last decade 
blackrocks russ koesterich called it a violent reaction 
the move stands to have broad repercussions for all americans not only will the us government have to pay more to borrow money but mortgage rates and car loan costs should also rise thats because treasuries are used as the benchmark for many other forms of credit 
as interest rates rise virtually everyone in our society is going to feel the pain 
those that need an auto loan in order to purchase a vehicle are going to find that loan payments are significantly higher than they were before 
credit card rates will also go up and those just getting out of school will discover that their student loan payments are even more suffocating 
but the biggest impact will be felt in the housing market the average rate on a year fixed mortgage just hit the psychologicallyimportant  percent barrier and that could mean big trouble for the housing market in   
the average contract rate on the popular year fixed mortgage hit  percent according to mortgage news daily a level most didnt expect to see until the middle of next year rates have now moved nearly a half a percentage point higher since donald trump was elected president 
the situation on the ground is panicked damage control said matthew graham chief operating officer of mortgage news daily people were trying to lock loans quickly last week and are now facing a tough choice to lock today or hope for a bounce many hoped for a bounce last week heading into the long weekend and we obviously didnt get it 
rising interest rates was one of the key factors that precipitated the financial crisis of  and many fear that it could happen again 
and without a doubt this rise in rates is going to affect the affordability of homes that are already on the market  
if youre going to buy a house and your mortgage payment went up by  or  you may buy a smaller house theres impact on interest rate sensitive sectors like autos and housing and also corporate bonds themselves where financial engineering has helped juice up the equity market said george goncalves head of rate strategy at nomura 
in addition rising rates will make it more difficult for those with adjustable rate mortgages to keep their homes foreclosure activity was already up  percent during the month of october and many are projecting that we could see another giant spike in foreclosures during the months ahead that is similar to what we saw during the last financial crisis 
many trump supporters dont really care what the rest of the world thinks of our new president but this is an area where what the rest of the world thinks really really matters 
the truth is that the rest of the planet is not all too fond of trump and if that makes them a lot less eager to lend us money that is a major problem 
the only way that we can maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is to continue to borrow gigantic mountains of money from the rest of the world at ultralow interest rates 
if the rest of the world starts demanding higher rates of return now that trump is president we are going to experience economic pain on a scale that most americans dont believe is possible 
one of our big lenders has been china and right now they are deeply   a trump presidency might mean trump has talked very tough about trade with china and the chinese are gearing up for a major trade war the following comes from cnbc  
during his election campaign this year trump spoke of a  percent import tariff on all chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work should any such policy come into effect china will take a titfortat approach according to an opinion piece in the global times  a newspaper backed by the communist party 
a batch of boeing orders will be replaced by airbus us auto and iphone sales in china will suffer a setback and us soybean and maize imports will be halted china can also limit the number of chinese students studying in the us the global times article read 
most trump supporters assume that since trump has been a very successful businessman that he will be able to strengthen the us economy 
but it isnt that simple 
the only reason we are able to live the way that we live today is because we have been able to borrow trillions upon trillions of dollars at irrationally low interest rates 
the moment the rest of the world decides that they are not going to loan us money at irrationally low interest rates any longer the game is over and it wont really matter who is in the white house at that point 
so watch interest rates very carefully if they keep going up it is inevitable that a major economic slowdown will follow no matter what economic policies the new trump administration implements november th   tags bank stocks  bond crash  bond traders  bonds  donald trump  economic news  feel the pain  financial  foreclosure  foreclosure activity  foreclosure activity rising  foreclosure help  foreclosures  foreclosures rising  good news  home foreclosures  pain  stocks  the dollar  the dow  the pain  the stock market  the us dollar  the us economy  the us financial system  trump  us consumers  category housing crash  the economy    mleblanc 
crash and burn house prices crash and burn houses go sky high while wages remain stagnant not sustainable time for a correction an excessive correction genada 
to lose weight you have to take some pain eat less work out same goes with making our economy work for americans we are going to need to take some pain to be able to improve the economy and make it work for every american and not just the top 
the rates had to go up they couldnt really go down anymore and its going to have some negative impacts but those impacts are due to living beyond our means and making bad choices now we will need to pay for that a bit 
lack of lending from others will require us to produce at all and thats a good thing producing at home will lead to more jobs and make us less depend on others less 
then the final major truth about the world economy is and you have detailed many times is that the worlds debt is far in excess of what can be payed its time for write downs and admit this then after the pain of that to put things in place to prevent this from happening again retired 
ultimately we have them all by the gonads with the eu sinking into bankruptcy america will be the last major consumer market left standing the american consumer economy is over  of the total economy the exporting nations have no where else to sell their consumer products  raw materialsthey will need to keep the american economy afloat as for the debtit will never be paidit will be rolled over indefinitely alsothere will be financial chaos around the world when america drops the hammer on the outside world most of the big money from outside will be drawn to america for securitysouth florida is already a haven for wealthy venezuelans who had money parked here for hard times in their homelandcalifornia is in a similar situation with offshore chinese wealth most of the world is part of a global financial system based on american dollars as the worlds reserve currencya large part of the world arein effect provinces in an american financial empireamerica is their bankerthey cant extricate themselves from the dollar  america paul anders 
bottom line is one day soon this house of cards is coming downtrump or no trump but if he can drain the swamp and get the political cesspool back on track i think its worth the pain pain is coming sooner or later anyways retired 
the main thing is to get rid of the central bankers  get a leash on the fire economywhich is mostly huge overhead  is sucking the life out of the real productive economy if it takes pain in the correction we will need to handle it if we want to turn the economic corner castiel

" very depressing economic realities that donald trump will inherit from barack obama   th  
it would be a grave mistake to understate the amount of damage that has been done to the us economy over the past eight years in this article i am going to share some economic numbers with you that are extremely sobering anyone that takes a cold hard honest look at the numbers should be able to see that our economy is in terrible shape unfortunately the way that we see things is often clouded by our political views up until the election democrats were far more likely then republicans to believe that the economy was improving but now that is in the process of completely reversing according to gallup  only  percent of republicans believed that the economy was getting better before the election but that number has suddenly jumped to  percent after trumps election victory and the percentage of democrats that believe that the economy is getting better fell from  percent to  percent after the election here are some additional details from gallup  
after trump won last weeks election republicans and republicanleaning independents now have a much more optimistic view of the us economys outlook than they did   just  of republicans said the economy was getting better in the week before the election while  said it was getting worse since the election  say it is getting better and  worse 
conversely democrats and democraticleaning independents confidence in the economy plummeted after the election before the election  of democrats said the economy was getting better and  worse now democrats are evenly divided with  saying it is getting better and  saying it is getting worse 
the truth of course is that the result of the election did not somehow magically alter the outlook for the us economy 
we still have a giant mess on our hands and the following are  very depressing economic realities that donald trump will inherit from barack obama 
 nearly  out of every  americans have less than  in savings  that means that about twothirds of the country is essentially living paycheck to paycheck at this moment 
 reuters is reporting that us mall investors are poised to lose billions of dollars as the  retail apocalypse  in this nation deepens 
 credit card delinquencies have hit the highest level that we have seen since   
 approximately  percent of all americans have a debt that is at least  days past due 
 the rate of homeownership has fallen for eight years in a row and is now hovering near a  year low  
 the total number of government employees now outnumbers the total number of manufacturing employees in this country by almost  million  
 the number of homeless people in new york city where donald trump is from has hit a brand new record high  
 about  percent of all young adults are currently living with their parents  
 total household debt in the united states has now reached a grand total of  trillion dollars  
 the total amount of corporate debt in the us has nearly doubled since the end of  
 when barack obama entered the white house the us government was  trillion dollars in debt today the us national debt is currently sitting at a staggering total of   
despite nearly doubling the national debt during his eight years in the white house barack obama is going to be the only president in united states history to never have a single year when us gdp grew by at least three percent 
so will donald trump waltz in and suddenly turn everything around 
just like when george w bush was elected there is a lot of optimism about the future right now among republicans 
and in  republicans are going to have control of the senate and the house in addition to being in control of the white house 
but does that mean that they will actually get anything done 
for a moment lets review what didnt happen the last time the republicans were in this position the following is an extended excerpt from an article by author devvy kidd   the republicans had control of both houses of congress part of the time during bush jrs two terms did they lock down our borders no did they pass legislation to stop all funding for illegals which would selfdeport millions of liars cheats and thieves no read please how to selfdeport millions of illegals  did they stop trillions in unconstitutional spending no did they get rid of any of clintons unconstitutional executive orders one or two but otherwise let comrade bill clinton crap in our faces did they get rid of one unconstitutional cabinet like hhs department of education and epa no did they stop the unconstitutional foreign aid no did they stop unconstitutional spending for planned parenthood no congress just continues to use borrowed money to spend more debt did they stop unconstitutional spending for the gigantic hoax called global warming or climate change no trump the left just lost the war on climate change did bush jr get us out of all the destructive trade treaties killing american jobs no did they crack down on visas bringing in tens of thousands of foreign workers when american workers who want to work are left in the unemployment line no did they stop more and more federal regulations strangling americas businesses no did they impeach one single activist judge destroying our freedom and liberty no a republican controlled congress with a republican in the white house and they did virtually nothing to restore america to a constitutional republic and constitutional spending  
so will things be any different under a trump administration 
we shall see 
there will be tremendous pressure to maintain the status quo in many instances because the process of fixing things would undoubtedly make conditions worse in the shortterm 
a great example of this is the national debt as i discussed yesterday  the only reason why we are able to enjoy such a massively inflated standard of living in this country     federal government started spending only the money that it brought in through taxes our ridiculous debt  would begin collapsing immediately 
we consume far more wealth than we produce and the only way that we are able to do this is by borrowing insane amounts of money 
either donald trump will continue to borrow money recklessly or we will go into a major league economic downturn 
it really is that simple 
but when our politicians borrow money they are literally destroying the future of this country so the choice is pain in the shortterm or greater pain in the longterm 
there is a way out and that would involve shutting down the federal reserve and going to a completely debtfree form of money but that is a topic for another article 
and unfortunately that is not something that is even on donald trumps radar at this point 
no matter who won the election the next president was going to be faced with some very harsh economic realities 
there are many out there that have faith that donald trump can pull off an unprecedented economic miracle but there are others that are deeply skeptical 
let us hope for the best but let us also keep preparing for the worst",Fake
"why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money by   th  
if donald trump truly wants to fix the economy he must shut down the federal reserve if he just tries to patch up our current system he will fail because it has been fundamentally flawed from the very beginning a little over a century ago very powerful forces on wall street convinced congress to completely restructure our financial system an immensely powerful central bank known as the federal reserve was created and the goal was to transform the us dollar into a debtbased currency that would continuously be inflated and to create an endless debt spiral from which   could never possibly escape sadly they were successful on both counts since the creation of the federal reserve the value of the us dollar has declined by approximately  percent and our national debt has gotten more than  times larger  
americans tend to give most of the credit or most of the blame for the performance of the us economy to our presidents but the truth is that an unelected unaccountable group of central bankers has far more power over our economy than anyone else does the federal reserve has become known as  the fourth branch of government  but unlike the other branches of government we are told that the feds decisions are above politics because they are too important fed officials fiercely guard their independence and they fiercely resist any interference from congress the president or the american people 
donald trump can try to lower taxes and reduce regulations but what he will be able to do to influence the economy pales in comparison to the immensely powerful tools that the fed wields the fed controls interest rates the fed controls the money supply and the fed regulates the banks 
to give you an idea of how enormously powerful the fed is i want you to pull out a dollar bill 
as you look at that dollar bill i want you to notice that it says federal reserve note right at the top 
in the financial world a note is an instrument of debt and the truth is that our system was designed to create as much debt as possible 
so why are we using debtbased federal reserve notes in the first place shouldnt congress have control over our currency 
according to article i section  of the us constitution  it is congress that has the authority to coin money regulate the value thereof and of foreign coin and fix the standard of weights and measures 
so how did the fed get involved 
well it is a very long and convoluted story and if you are interested in the history behind it i would commend to you an excellent book by c edward griffin entitled  the creature from jekyll island a second look at the federal reserve  basically big money interests on wall street got their hooks into the white house and congress and they rushed through legislation right before christmas in  that created this insidious central banking system that was designed to slowly but surely take wealth from the american people and put it into their hands 
sadly most americans dont even realize that we have a debtbased currency nor do they understand where our money comes from in a previous article  i discussed how money is normally created by the federal reserve under our current system 
when the us government decides that it wants to spend another billion dollars that it does not have it does not print up a billion dollars 
rather the us government creates a bunch of us treasury bonds debt and takes them over to the federal reserve 
the federal reserve creates a billion dollars out of thin air and exchanges them for the us treasury bonds 
the federal reserve takes the us treasury bonds that it receives in exchange for the federal reserve notes that it gave to the government and it auctions off those bonds to the highest bidder  but of course this process always creates more debt than it does money 
the us treasury bonds that the federal reserve receives in exchange for the money it has created out of nothing are auctioned off through the federal reserve system 
but wait 
there is a problem 
because the us government must pay interest on the treasury bonds the amount of debt that has been created by this transaction is greater than the amount of money that has been created 
so where will the us government get the money to pay that debt 
well the theory is that we can get money to circulate through the economy really really fast and tax it at a high enough rate that the government will be able to collect enough taxes to pay the debt 
but that never actually happens does it 
and the creators of the federal reserve understood this as well they understood that the us government would not have enough money to both run the government and service the national debt they knew that the us government would have to keep borrowing even more money in an attempt to keep up with the game 
so our debt just keeps going up and up and up while barack obama has been in the white house our national debt has risen by more than  trillion dollars and at this moment it is sitting just under the  trillion dollar mark  
but we shouldnt be surprised by this because this is precisely what the federal reserve system was designed to do to us 
many conservatives still hold to the mistaken illusion that we could somehow pay all of this debt back someday but as i have shown in a previous article this is mathematically impossible to do  
if the government went out today and grabbed every single dollar in existence we could not pay back the national debt and of course we have   of household debt   of corporate debt and   of state and local government debt that we need to pay back as well 
under the current system our only hope is to keep the wheel spinning by continuing to devalue the dollar and by continuing to go into even greater amounts of debt 
and of course it isnt just the united states that is in this predicament at this point almost every single nation on the entire planet has a central bank 
even though there are extremely sharp disagreements among nations on virtually everything else somehow central banking has achieved nearly universal adoption 
as you read this article well over  of the population of the globe lives in a country that has a central bank 
do you think that is just a coincidence 
of course there are still a few very small countries such as the federated states of micronesia that do not have a central bank but the only big nation not to have one is north korea 
and you would literally have to be insane to want to live in north korea 
but now we have an opportunity to get free from this insidious system the truth is that we dont have to have a central bank in fact the greatest period of economic growth in us history was when there was no central bank  
we dont need central planners to set our interest rates and to manipulate our money supply they will never admit this but the reality of the matter is that their interference in the economy often creates tremendous economic busts 
since the federal reserve was created in  there have been  distinct recessions or depressions                    
considering their track record isnt it time for a change 
and we dont have to have a debtbased currency in fact not too long ago we had a president that decided to start issuing debtfree united states notes 
back in  president john f kennedy issued executive order  which authorized the us treasury to issue debtfree united states notes which were directly created by the us government 
he was assassinated shortly thereafter 
most americans dont realize this but many of the debtfree united states notes that were issued under president kennedy are still in circulation today  and president trump could do something similar 
but will he 
it has been said that the borrower is the servant of the lender and the federal reserve system has turned all of us into debt slaves 
debt is a form of social control and the global elite use all of this debt to dominate the planet the total amount of debt in the world just hit   of  trillion dollars  and the longer we allow the central banks to control the system the bigger this debt bubble will become 
  here in the united states that starts with shutting   issuing debtfree currency it would take someone very bold to make a move like this and so let us hope that the man that we just elected is up to the task",Fake
"why we are still in the danger zone until january th    th  
donald trump is not the president yet and barack obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the white house prior to the election i described the period of time ending on january th as the danger zone and my outlook has not changed just because donald trump was victorious on election night as you will see the next two months are an absolutely critical time and if we can get through january th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier at least for a while on the other hand the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos a lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of trumps victory but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard 
and the truth is that donald trump has not even won the presidency yet as i detailed shortly before election night  the next president will not be determined until december th when the electoral college meets 
on monday december th the members of the electoral college will gather in all  state capitals to cast their votes for president it is then and only then that the next president of the united states will be elected 
throughout our history electors have followed the will of the people more than  perfect of the time but there have been faithless electors before and if democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in december it is still possible though not probable that hillary clinton could win the election 
one petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than  million people the petition claims that donald trump is unfit to serve as president and that since hillary clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead the following comes from a usa today article entitled  could the electoral college elect hillary clinton instead of donald trump  
a changeorg petition now signed by more than  million people encourages members of the electoral college to cast their votes for hillary clinton when the college meets on dec  the petition argues that donald trump is unfit to serve and that secretary clinton won the popular vote and should be president 
if they all vote the way their states voted donald trump will win the petition states however they can vote for hillary clinton if they choose even in states where that is not allowed their vote would still be counted they would simply pay a small fine  which we can be sure clinton supporters will be glad to pay we are calling on the electors to ignore their states votes and cast their ballots for secretary clinton 
personally i dont believe that this is going to happen they may be able to flip a few electors but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the democrats to overcome 
however that is not the only concern we are facing ever since his victory on november th there have been a multitude of violent threats against donald trump and his family and without a doubt there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep donald trump from getting to inauguration day so let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family 
if donald trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the electoral college vote on december th mike pence would take his place 
but if something were to happen to him before december th his electors would be free to vote for another candidate  including hillary clinton 
if everything goes smoothly and donald trump successfully makes it to inauguration day he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in united states history 
in an article for the most important news  i showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon washington dc on january th in order to disrupt the inauguration festivities as much as possible 
this giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects and they have already put up facebook pages  websites  and the hashtag disruptj is being widely used all over social media 
traditionally inauguration day is a day of joy and celebration but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot 
let us hope that they are not successful 
another reason why we will be in the danger zone over the next two months is because of what barack obama may choose to do at the united nations 
now that it looks like donald trump is going to be our next president the international pressure on barack obama to do something at the united nations regarding the israelipalestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense 
and this is something that trump and his advisers are actively concerned about in fact i came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the trump team is warning obama against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office  
saying that pushing agendas contrary to the presidentelects position would not be in the spirit of the transition trump national security advisor for donald trump last week warned the obama administration against making moves on the israelipalestinian conflict in his last months in office 
on big transformative issues where president obama and presidentelect trump are not in alignment i dont think its in keeping with the spirit of the transitionto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the presidentelects positions the advisor told politico  
specifically the concern is that obama may decide to support a un security council resolution that would officially recognize a palestinian state set the parameters for a two state solution and establish east jerusalem as the capital for the new palestinian state 
just a few weeks ago an article in the wall street journal entitled  obamas israel surprise  reported that this is one of the options that the obama administration is strongly considering right now a un security council resolution would be legally binding on both israel and the palestinians and it would be something that president trump would not be able to undo 
the rest of the un security council is eager to support such a resolution and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of barack obama and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do the following comes from an article by leo hohmann  
the wall street journal reported one week before tuesdays election that obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decadesold israelipalestinian conflict 
israeli diplomats according to the wsj story are preparing for the possibility that a lameduck president obama may try to force a diplomatic resolution for israel and the palestinians at the united nations 
the president is presumably now reviewing those options which number about half a dozen 
he may be preparing to recognize a palestinian state at the un before he leaves office  wsj reported 
if barack obama decides to divide the land of israel at the united nations it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency i have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in america if it happens and it will also mean that many of the events that i warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating 
but if we can get to january th and the land of israel has not been divided yet we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while because trump has already said that he would not support a un security council resolution that forces a solution on the israelis and palestinians 
when politicians are going to do something that they know people wont like they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arent paying attention for example yesterday i discussed how the legislation that created the federal reserve was rushed through congress right before christmas in   
so keep an eye on the period around thanksgiving and the period around christmas if barack obama is going to stab israel in the back it may happen during one of those times 
my hope is that we can get through january th without anything going seriously wrong if that happens i know that i will be very thankful 
and as i detailed in a previous article  donald trump will be  years  months and  days old on his first full day in office on january st and that will happen in year  on the hebrew calendar 
could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe 
or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation 
i believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions

i am a political atheist just to set the record straight although i visit this site fairly often it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear when george w as elected there were many protesters they were just hidden away in free speech zones of course there are many unhappy people as there were in  and every election trumps votes were less than  of the  million people in the country will trump bring jobs no not unless they are govt employees or funded by taxes there is only one way jobs are created and that is when there is demand for products and services a lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities let alone keep playing the consumerism game i cannot see obama doing anything that requires legislation as he is lame duck status now perhaps this site needs to focus on the swamp getting filled with more careerists especially lobbyists i have been an expat for over  years it is a lovely peaceful warm day here think i will go for a bicycle ride then a dip in  degree seawater i do have faith that not much will change and the sun will continue to rise even when it is obscured by clouds peace and loveit is the only way df nj

there are many forms of freedom you criticize the left but you just dont understand it heres how the left thinks 
an old english judge once said necessitous men are not free men liberty requires opportunity to make a living  a living decent according to the standard of the time a living which gives man not only enough to live by but something to live for 
for too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality a small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peoples property other peoples money other peoples labor  other peoples lives for too many of us life was no longer free liberty no longer real men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness 
against economic tyranny such as this the american citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government  
you many not agree with this approach but all the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country the sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value 
but do not fear every year the top  become richer and richer every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a governments currency collapse once the currency collapses people in bread lines will demand more government not less

"why is obama threatening russia with world war  right before the election   october th  
it sure seems like an odd time to be provoking a war with russia as i write this we stand just a little bit more than three weeks away from one of the most pivotal elections in us history and barack obama has chosen this moment to strongly threaten the russians as i wrote about on friday  reuters is reporting that obama is contemplating direct us military action against syrian military targets and the russians have already indicated that any assault on syrian forces would be considered an attack on themselves the rapidly deteriorating crisis in syria has already caused tensions with russia to rise to the highest level since the end of the cold war but now obama is adding fuel to the fire by publicly considering an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia apparently obama believes that russian hackers are interfering in the election and so he wants payback the following comes from an nbc news article entitled  cia prepping for possible cyber strike against russia  
the obama administration is contemplating an unprecedented cyber covert action against russia in retaliation for alleged russian interference in the american presidential election  us intelligence officials told nbc news 
current and former officials with direct knowledge of the situation say the cia has been asked to deliver options to the white house for a wideranging clandestine cyber operation designed to harass and embarrass the kremlin leadership 
the sources did not elaborate on the exact measures the cia was considering but said the agency had already begun opening cyber doors selecting targets and making other preparations for an operation  
somebody should tell obama that he is not playing a video game a cyber attack is considered to be an act of war and the russians would inevitably retaliate and considering how exceedingly vulnerable our cyber infrastructure is i dont know if that is something that we want to invite 
at the end of last week vice president joe biden also publicly threatened the russians  
on friday vice president joe biden met meet the press host chuck todd for an interview that has raised serious concern in russia 
without bothering to question the authenticity of the claims todd took the allegations of russian hacking at face value opening his interview with a loaded question why havent we sent a message yet to putin 
after a moment of stunned silence biden responded were sending a message we have the capacity to do it and it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that will have the greatest impact 
when todd asked if the public will know a message was sent biden replied hope not 
the russians firmly deny that they had any involvement in the hacking and so far the obama administration has not publicly produced any firm evidence that the russians were behind it 
perhaps the obama administration privately has some evidence but at this point they have not shown that evidence to the american public 
so for joe biden to be making these sorts of threats is a very dangerous thing the russians are taking these threats very seriously and they are preparing to protect their interests  
the threats directed against moscow and our states leadership are unprecedented because they are voiced at the level of the us vice president 
to the backdrop of this aggressive unpredictable line we must take measures to protect our interests to hedge risks a kremlin spokesman said according to ria novosti news agency 
here in the united states most people dont even realize that we could be on the verge of a major conflict with russia 
but over in russia things are completely different talk of war is everywhere and the potential for war is the number one topic in the russian media right now just check out some of the recent russian media headlines about the conflict between our two nations 
 in contrast to clinton trump has no appetite for war with russia  
and one russian television network recently instructed their viewers to locate the nearest bomb shelter in case a nuclear war between the united states and russia suddenly erupts 
a terrifying russian television broadcast explicitly told civilians to find out where their nearest bomb shelter is and repeatedly asked viewers if they were ready for nuclear war 
one apocalyptic broadcast told viewers on moscows stateowned tv channel ntv if it should one day happen every one of you should know where the nearest bomb shelter is its best to find out now 
i dont believe that the russians are crazy to be thinking that a war might be coming 
to me it almost seems as though obama wants one 
could it be possible that a conflict with russia will be used to alter change or influence the upcoming election in november 
the truth is that it isnt going to take much for the shooting to begin if obama orders airstrikes against syrian forces the russians have said that they will shoot back  
ash carter has threatened russia with consequences after blowing up the ceasefire the pentagon  supported by the joint chiefs of staff  now is peddling potential strikes on syrias air force to punish the regime for what the pentagon actually did blow up the ceasefire one cant make this stuff up 
majorgeneral igor konashenkov russias defense ministry spokesman sent a swift message to our colleagues in washington think twice if you believe you can get away with launching a shadow hot war against russia russia will target any stealthunidentified aircraft attacking syrian government targets  and they will be shot down 
the only serious question then is whether an out of control pentagon will force the russian air force  false flag and otherwise  to knock out us air force fighter jets and whether moscow has the fire power to take out each and every one of them 
i discussed the potential for war with russia in my latest video  hopefully cooler heads will prevail and war with russia will be put off 
but without a doubt the crisis in syria is not going to be resolved any time soon because it is one giant mess most people dont realize that the syrian civil war has essentially been a proxy war between sunni islam and shia islam from the very beginning jihadist rebels that are being armed and funded by saudi arabia and turkey are fighting hezbollah troops that are being armed and funded by iran and now turkish forces have invaded northern syria and this threatens to cause a fullblown war to erupt between turkey and the syrian kurds of course isis is right in the middle of everything causing havoc blowing stuff up and beheading anyone that doesnt believe in their radical version of sunni islam 
it is absolutely insane that the united states and russia could potentially go to war because of this conflict both sides are determined to show the other how tough they are and one false move could set off a spiral of events from which they may be no recovery 
the american people very foolishly elected barack obama twice but up until now the consequences have not been quite as dire as many had been projecting 
however right here at the end of his second term obama is facing a moment of truth if he ends up dragging us into a war with russia the american people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the white house drowning in debt  percent of all americans have debt that is at least  days past due  guest 
if he obama ends up dragging us into a war with russia the american people will ultimately bitterly regret putting him into the white house 
oh i doubt it most americans just lap up the propaganda fed to them by the mainstream media that has incessantly demonized putin and other foreign leaders where is the outrage over what this administration has done in destabilizing libya and other sovereign nations in the middle east where is the outrage over what the bush administration did in iraq and afghanistan 
there is a video on youtube with general wesley clark discussing how the pentagon planned to attack  countries in  years google it jc teecher 
the reality of the general public putting an atheisticmuzzy into the white house will not strike home until their sons and daughters are coming home in body bags guest 
no when their sons and daughters come back in body bags their parents will wave that american flag and say that their children died to defend the freedoms of this country good grief jc teecher

additionally this lowlife ploy by the progressive liberal democrats is disgusting and changes nothing for many of us jfk was having an ongoing affair with marilyn monroe and im sure his secret service agents could have repeated some rather spicy language in which he described their sexual sessions but you know what neither jfks secret service agents nor the mainstream media said anything about the affair much less jfks private conversations about it because they had dignity respect for the office of potus and respect for jfk any one of those things alone should be enough to keep despicable actions of the democrats and the mainstream media from happening around the whole institution of the potus including the potential potus candidates however we see that neither the democrats nor the mainstream media have any honor truth or journalistic integrity remaining 
general george s patton and prime minister winston churchill were both as crude as they come in private and often in public but they got the job done when they were called upon maybe you dont consider donald trump in the same ranks as the above three men maybe you dont think donald trump can get the job done either way i couldnt care less what i do care about is the poor state of our country the damage that barack obama  the democrats have done and the damage that hillary clinton is sure to do for petes sake look at the shell of a city that used to be detroit mi look at chicago with doubledigit murders just about every week if you want the us to look like these longtime democratrun cities by all means vote for hillary clinton if not then the only other viable option is donald trump

"why is obama threatening russia with world war  right before the election michael on television we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash   november th  
since donald trumps victory on election night we have seen the worst bond crash in  years  global bond investors have seen trillions of dollars of wealth wiped out since november th and analysts are warning of another tough week ahead the general consensus in the investing community is that a trump administration will mean much higher inflation and as a result investors are already starting to demand higher interest rates unfortunately for all of us history has shown that higher interest rates always cause an economic slowdown and this makes perfect sense because economic activity naturally slows down when it becomes more expensive to borrow money the obama administration had already set up the next president for a major recession anyway but now this bond crash threatens to bring it on sooner rather than later 
for those that are not familiar with the bond market when yields go up bond prices go down and when bond prices go down that is bad news for economic growth 
so we generally dont want yields to go up 
unfortunately yields have been absolutely soaring over the past couple of weeks and the yield on  year treasury notes has now jumped one full percentage point since july  
the year treasury yield jumped to  in late trading on friday the highest since december  up  basis point since the election and up one full percentage point since july 
the year yield is at a critical juncture in terms of reality the first thing that might happen is a rate increase by the fed in december after a year of flipflopping a slew of postelection pronouncements by fed heads  including yellens relatively soon  have pushed the odds of a rate hike to  
as i noted the other day  so many things in our financial system are tied to yields on us treasury notes just look at what is happening to mortgages as wolf richter has noted  the average rate on  year mortgages is shooting into the stratosphere 
the carnage in bonds has consequences the average interest rate of the a conforming year fixed mortgage as of friday was quoted at  for top credit scores thats up about  percentage point from just before the election according to mortgage news daily  it put the month on a short list of  worst months in more than a decade 
if mortgage rates continue to shoot higher there will be another housing crash 
rates on auto loans credit cards and student loans will also be affected throughout our economic system it will become much more costly to borrow money and that will inevitably slow the overall economy down 
why bond investors are so on edge these days is because of statements such as this one from steve bannon  
in a nascent administration that seems at best random in its beliefs bannon can seem to be not just a focused voice but almost a messianic one 
like andrew jacksons populism were going to build an entirely new political movement he says its everything related to jobs the conservatives are going to go crazy im the guy pushing a trilliondollar infrastructure plan with negative interest rates throughout the world its the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything ship yards iron works get them all jacked up were just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks it will be as exciting as the s greater than the reagan revolution  conservatives plus populists in an economic nationalist movement 
steve bannon is going to be one of the most influential voices in the new trump administration and he is absolutely determined to get this trillion dollar infrastructure plan through congress 
and that is going to mean a lot more borrowing and a lot more spending for a government that is already on pace to add  trillion dollars to the national debt this fiscal year 
sadly all of this comes at a time when the us economy is already starting to show significant signs of slowing down it is being projected that we will see a sixth straight decline in yearoveryear earnings for the sp  and industrial production has now contracted for  months in a row  
the truth is that the economy has been barely treading water for quite some time now and it isnt going to take much to push us over the edge the following comes from lance roberts  
with an economy running at below  consumers already heavily indebted wage growth weak for the bulk of americans there is not a lot of wiggle room for policy mistakes 
combine weak economics with higher interest rates which negatively impacts consumption and a stronger dollar which weighs on exports and you have a real potential of a recession occurring sooner rather than later 
yes the stock market soared immediately following trumps election but it wasnt because economic conditions actually improved 
if you look at history a stock market crash almost always follows a major bond crash so if bond prices keep declining rapidly that is going to be a very ominous sign for stock traders 
and history has also shown us that no bull market can survive a major recession if the economy suffers a major downturn early in the trump administration it is inevitable that stock prices will follow 
the waning days of the obama administration have set us up perfectly for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash 
of course any problems that occur after january th  will be blamed on trump but the truth is that obama will be far more responsible for what happens than trump will be 
right now so many people have been lulled into a sense of complacency because donald trump won the election 
that is an enormous mistake 
a shaking has already begun in the financial world and this shaking could easily become an avalanche 
now is not a time to party rather it is time to batten down the hatches and to prepare for very rough seas ahead 
all of the things that so many experts warned were coming may have been delayed slightly but without a doubt they are still on the way 
so get prepared while you still can because time is running out",Fake
"when americans shall say peace and safety by michael snyder on november st  
millions of americans are expecting a new golden age for america under donald trump but is that what they are going to get there is always optimism when a new president is elected but i dont know if i have ever seen anything like the euphoria that many trump supporters are expressing right now look i voted for donald trump and i want him to be as successful as possible but when donald trump becomes our next president on january th  that does not mean that all of the great problems that our nation is facing will somehow magically disappear if you listen to some people they make it sound like america is going to experience nothing but peace prosperity and blessing for decades to come i would love it if that was indeed going to be the case but unfortunately that is simply not the truth 
we are currently on a path that leads to national suicide and unless we change our ways it isnt going to matter who is in the white house 
i keep hearing about how our new president is going to unify the nation but that is going to be extremely difficult to do considering the fact that we are now more divided than ever in fact a brand new gallup survey found that an alltime record high  percent of all americans believe that we are greatly divided when it comes to the most important values  
i keep hearing about how we are now entering a golden age of peace and prosperity but how is that supposed to happen while we are still butchering millions of innocent children in our abortion mills 
i keep hearing about how the economy is about to take off like a rocket but how is that possible when we have already been on the greatest debt binge in world history  the only way we have been able to maintain our massively inflated debtfueled standard of living is by piling up debt at a faster pace than any generation in history today we have accumulated  trillion dollars in consumer debt corporate debt has doubled since the last financial crisis and the national debt is rapidly approaching  trillion dollars how can trump possibly pump up our standard of living with debt more than obama has already done 
i keep hearing about how we are going to make america great again but how can we be great when we are producing more pornography than the rest of the world combined 
i keep hearing about how law and order is going to restored but meanwhile chaos has already been erupting in cities all over the nation and the far left is planning to turn inauguration day into a major riot  
i keep hearing about how things are going to go back to the way they used to be but as i discussed in a previous article  sexuallytransmitted diseases are spreading at the fastest pace in decades the percentage of births out of wedlock is more than  times higher than in  and approximately two out of every three christian men watch pornography on a regular basis 
i keep hearing about how we are going to drain the swamp and yet there are no plans to even reform the federal reserve system which is at the very heart of our financial problems as a nation  
i keep hearing about how good judges are going to be put on the supreme court but how can we trust that when our new president just said that he is fine with the supreme court decision that forced all  states to redefine the institution of marriage 
i keep hearing about how we are going to be an example for the rest of the world but how can we be an example when just about every form of evil imaginable is exploding in popularity inside our own country 
i keep hearing about how our government is going to be blessed but how can a government that gives hundreds of millions of dollars a year to planned parenthood be blessed now that the republicans have control of the white house the senate and the house of representatives this is their golden opportunity to defund planned parenthood if it doesnt happen now it probably will never happen and it will show what a complete and utter failure the republican party has become remember planned parenthood is an organization that has been caught on camera admitting that they harvest organs from the babies that they kill and that they sell those organs off to the highest bidder 
some would argue that america is already great at a lot of things after all the united states is number one in the world in television watching legal drug use and illegal drug use

we have the highest std infection rate in the industrialized world the highest divorce rate in the industrialized world and the largest prison population on the entire planet 
we also have the most complicated tax system in the entire world the largest trade deficit in the entire world and the largest national debt in the entire world 
so if we want to make america great again we sure have a lot of work to do 
the complacency that i am seeing out there right now really alarms me so many people seem to think that the battle is won because donald trump was victorious on election night but that is not even close to reality 
if we do not fundamentally change course as a nation we will not survive tinkering with tax rates regulations and trade agreements is not going to get the job done so many people are acting as if we just have a few cuts and scratches when the reality is what our country really needs is major heart surgery 
donald trump is not some sort of a messiah and even if he is able to accomplish every single thing that he is promising right now it will not nearly be enough 
but for the moment millions of americans are proclaiming peace and safety now that donald trump has won the election and we shall see how it all turns out november st   tags americans  anxiety  blessing  donald trump  national suicide  peace  safety  successful  suicide  trump  category commentary we are being set up for higher interest rates a major recession and a giant stock market crash",Fake
"are the polls rigged against trump all of these wildly divergent surveys cannot possibly be correct michael on television half of the population of the world is dirt poor  and the global elite want to keep it that way   nd  
could you survive on just  a day according to compassion international  approximately half of the population of the entire planet currently lives on  a day or less meanwhile those hoarding wealth at the very top of the global pyramid are rapidly becoming a lot wealthier dont get me wrong  i am a very big believer in working hard and contributing something of value to society and those that work the hardest and contribute the most should be able to reap the rewards in this article i am in no way shape or form criticizing true capitalism because if true capitalism were actually being practiced all over the planet we would have far far less poverty today instead our planet is dominated by a heavily socialized debtbased central banking system that systematically transfers wealth from hard working ordinary citizens to the global elite those at the very top of the pyramid know that they are impoverishing everyone else and they very much intend to keep it that way 
lets start with some of the hard numbers according to zero hedge  credit suisse had just released their yearly report on global wealth and it shows that  percent of all the wealth in the world is controlled by just  percent of the people 
as credit suisse tantalizingly shows year after year the number of people who control just shy of a majority of global net worth or  of the roughly  trillion in household wealth is declining progressively relative to the total population of the world and in  the number of people who are worth more than  million was just  million roughly  of the worlds population of adults on the other end of the pyramid some  billion adults had a net worth of less than  accounting for just about  trillion in household wealth 
and since this is a yearly report we can go back and see how things have changed over time when zero hedge did this it was discovered that the wealth of those at the very top has nearly doubled over the past six years and meanwhile the poor have gotten even poorer 
incidentally we tracked down the first credit suisse report we found in this series from   where the total wealth of the top layer in the pyramid was a modest  trillion for the worlds millionaires it has nearly doubled in the  years since then meanwhile the worlds poorest have gotten you got it poorer as those adults who were worth less than  in  had a combined net worth of  trillion a number which has since declined to  trillion in  despite a half a billion increase in the sample size 
if these trends continue at this pace it wont be too long before the global elite have virtually all of the wealth and the rest of us have virtually nothing 
perhaps you are fortunate enough to still have a good job and you live in a large home and you will sleep in a warm bed tonight 
well you should consider yourself to be very blessed because that is definitely not the case for most of the rest of the world the following  facts about global poverty come from dosomethingcom  and i want you to really let these numbers sink in for a moment nearly  of the worlds population  more than  billion people  live on less than  a day more than  billion live in extreme poverty  less than  a day  billion children worldwide are living in poverty according to unicef  children die each day due to poverty  million people worldwide do not have enough food to eat  food banks are especially important in providing food for people that cant afford it themselves run a food drive outside your local grocery store so people in your community have enough to eat sign up for supermarket stakeout  more than  million people lack adequate access to clean drinking water  diarrhea caused by inadequate drinking water sanitation and hand hygiene kills an estimated  people every year globally or approximately  people per day in   million children under the age  were stunted reduced rate of growth and development due to chronic malnutrition preventable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia take the lives of  million children a year who are too poor to afford proper treatment as of   million children under  year of age worldwide had not received the three recommended doses of vaccine against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis  of all humans live without electricity  approximately  billion people  of the world population lives on less than  a day  oxfam estimates that it would take  billion annually to end extreme global povertythats less than  the income of the top  richest billionaires the world food programme says the poor are hungry and their hunger traps them in poverty hunger is the number one cause of death in the world killing more than hivaids malaria and tuberculosis combined 
so how did we get here 
debt is the primary mechanism that takes wealth from ordinary people like you and me and puts it into the hands of the global elite 
in my recent article entitled  why donald trump must shut down the federal reserve and start issuing debtfree money  i discussed how the federal reserve was designed to entrap the us government in an endless debt spiral from which it could never possibly escape and that is precisely what has happened as the us national debt has gotten more than  times larger since the federal reserve was created in  
in that very same year the federal income tax was instituted and that is a key part of the program for the global elite you see the income tax is how wealth is transferred from us to the government and then a continuously growing national debt is how that wealth is transferred from the government to the elite 
it is a very complicated system but at the end of the day it is all about taking money from us and getting it into their pockets 
and at this point more than  percent of the population of the world lives in a country with a central bank and almost every nation on the planet has some form of income tax 
it is a global system that is designed to create as much debt as possible and i recently shared with my readers that the total amount of debt in the world has hit a staggering   of  trillion dollars  
interestingly the bible actually foretells of a time when rich men would hoard wealth in the last days the following are the first five verses of the book of james in the modern english version  
come now you rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you  your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten  your gold and silver are corroded and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire you have stored up treasures for the last days  indeed the wages that you kept back by fraud from the laborers who harvested your fields are crying and the cries of those who harvested have entered into the ears of the lord of hosts  you have lived in pleasure on the earth and have been wayward you have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter 
so much of the time we focus on the other great sins that we see all around us but the truth is that one of the greatest sins of all in our world today is the sin of greed 
the borrower is the servant of the lender and the global elite have used various forms of debt to turn the rest of the planet into their debt slaves 
as debt levels race higher and higher all over the planet the elite are using the magic of compound interest to grab a bigger and bigger share of the pie 
given enough time those at the very top would have virtually everything and the rest of us would have virtually nothing the middle class is shrinking all over the globe and the gap between the wealthy and the poor continues to grow at an astounding pace 
but the vast majority of people out there have no idea how money debt taxes and central banks really work and so they have no idea that this is purposely being done to them

the reason that american police love just shooting people instead of actually working and risking their safety for the safety of the people is because they are blood thirsty cowboy dirty harry brain washed psychopaths that love killing it is american culture at the root deep in the psyche 
the police have been militarized they dont do the job like in the old days no more negotiators drs or counselling at the scene of the crisis its just shoot bang bang boom yourr dead if you had a gun knife glow stick sandwich whatever gary honeycutt 
how old are you the old days you mention with negotiators and counselors came into vogue nationally in the s after a period of democrat rule notable for their most outstanding accomplishment a huge escalation of criminals rights over those of victims note the escalation of crime since then it seems you are also on the anticop bandwagon i support them being able to defend themselves mistakes can be made in a split second the same amount of time it might take for a criminal to kill a cop im sure you can name victims of cops do you realize what a small percentage of interactions between cops and the public they constitute unfortunately the justified shootings like the ferguson case are unfairly included in many of our perceptions first and foremost dont commit crime that improves your odds drastically next comply with orders given by the police if you were raised to treat the police as hostile someone failed you guilty or innocent comply the police are just trying to do their job dont complicate it ive seen many an arrest where a person taunts and struggles with the police even up to resisting being put in the car try walking a mile in their shoes they are trying to keep the public safe and they have a right to be safe themselves fluffnik 
guilty or innocent comply 
land of the free 
most places are successfully policed by consent and without shooting their citizens or suffering much crime gary honeycutt 
yes if an officer wants to see identification he has a reason if he wants you to keep your hands in plain sight he has a reason he is possibly ruling you out as a person of interest that was seen in the area imagine how much more efficiently that would go if each person would refrain from shouting about their rights for  minutes before complying if you are the person in question the transaction could be handled in a couple of minutes and youll be gone without any violence or hard feelings if you pay taxes you will have helped us get our moneys worth of course if youve seen the news and the reality shows you may have the impression that a lot of these guys that are giving a cop a load of crap probably live off of what you are paying to the government mike 
wasnt raised hostile to cops family members are cops as a matter of fact this is america if im not committing a crime or suspected of it dont ask me for papers dont detain me dont run dui checkpoints those are infringements on all of our freedom which i assume we love safety is what the left uses to excuse their behavior safety is a fallacy dufas_duck 
i have had  police officers in my extended family it got to the point that none of them were welcome into the rest of the familys homes they were eventually never invited to family get to gathers they were rude overbearing malicious individuals constantly bragging how they screwed some person and taught them how the world really should be their treatment of family members were more along the line of petty dictators where no matter the subject some familly member was wrong petty things like they didnt like the car they bought or their haircut or the job they worked at they were not satisfied with anything or anybody 
they brought their street attitude home with them they couldnt keep wives or husbands or significant others for very long they were arrogant mean and only thaought of themselvesanybody else was in their way 
i have seen gang members that have more ethics than these police and their freinds gary honeycutt 
my greatgrandfather his soninlaw my grandfatherand his son my uncle were all cops the oldest and youngest for their whole careers all deeply religious highly moral men dufas_duck 
that is great if they were straight arrow we need more like them my cop relatives and their friends would fit right in in the crips the bloods or just about any outlaw motorcycle club no one but other cops were proud of them my family sure wasnt proud of them gary honeycutt 
maybe they became hardened by what they faced daily east side of detroit south side of chicago people are products of their environment maybe the cops in branson mo and such places are nice guys what is the ratio of cops to citizens lets say youve got a playground with   year olds you get a dozen  year olds to keep order among them if the  are from sierra leone and the dozen are american boy scouts thered be  dead americans in short order any dead among the  wouldve been killed by their own so what do we expect of cops who grew up without a rap sheet graduated from school and passed the academy you think  years of patrolling the gnetto might change them they surely know the realities of the job better than we do how do the ones who arent in mayberry do a  or  year career in an inner city where shooting a cop makes you a hero and not resisting arrest makes you a pussy dufas_duck 
i do know that where i grew up the police at least tried to keep the officers from getting street hardened they rotated officers to different districts every month but then they found thst the police were trading assignments some cops didnt want to rotate out they wanted to stay where they were no explaination was given by any officerat least publically no answer was given 
many thought the cops were up to no good and wanted to stay in their own area to protct their interst dufas_duck 
you just gave the cops an excuse to act like gang members gary honeycutt 
i dont think so but you dont throw choirboys in blue to the wolves in the ghetto any more than you send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool dufas_duck 
 send a seal team to lifeguard the kiddie pool 
you havent checked out what school cops have been doing as of late then a  year old in handcuffs or throwing an  year old to the ground doesnt work out to be the way to increase trust among the populace anthony fredericks 
i will end this stupidity of your right now gary i work with police every single day as a emt every day i am a qualified expert on how police act on scenemost of them are very arrogant rude and aggressive towards people shut up or be quiet is the first thing you normally hear from a cop you always see them put someone on the ground even if that person is the one who called them for help if they dont like youboom face down knee on your neck cuffs on approximately  are not like this but the other  are this is reality gary and i have worked in several cities in different areasand it is all the same police are overbearing and have a chip on their shoulder against the general publicand a lot of them take it out physically on them gary honeycutt 
my sympathies for the flaw in your familys dna dufas_duck 
luckily the flaw was only in the extended family treeinlaws marriages etc  gary honeycutt 
most people who oppose dui checkpoints have a reason ive always seen a problem with bars having parking lots when it is illegal for good reason to drink and drive i dont mind providing my id when a cop asks for it when its done without giving him any lip it is over quickly without incident hes just trying to do the job we are paying for if you want to launch into a  minute tirade about your rights youll be there  minutes longer make it a bad night at work for the cop and wind you all up maybe you like that some people love drama mike 
the reason is its an infringement on your rights and unnecessarily exposes you and the officers to a potentially dangerous confrontation there is no way you believe that unwanted contact that is forced upon officers and the public increases their safety i wouldnt blame the officers for the policies they have to enforce however the higher ups never pay when things go wrong after the fact the problem with being law abiding is that by doing nothing wrong you dont see the infringement of your rights and tolerate them just because you arent guilty of anything doesnt mean your rights arent being taken from you what if for safety we decided that all firearms need removed from private citizens what if we decided that tsa should run mandatory random checkpoints all over the us creating  hour delays what if we decided that anyone that supports trump may be a violent extremist and should be stopped for questioning do you see where this goes 
i dont like the immigration ones inside the states of the southwest i dont like the agricultural ones into california and i dont like the dui checkpoints in the south im a legal resident dont transport crops and dont drink yet i oppose all of them the idea behind them is wellmeaning the execution is unlawful imo obviously the courts dont think so or theyd not exist gary honeycutt 
it is the officers job to initiate that confrontation despite the risk to himself he does it to lessen the chance that a drunk will run over you daughter at a crosswalk he stops people who fit the description of a wanted person in hopes of catching a criminal before he claims another victim perhaps raping your daughter what would you do in his place mike 
you are confusing the issues here zero issue stopping and talking with someone who is suspected or witnessed committing a crime 
dui checkpoints are  stop and question with zero probable cause have you been in states where they run these the road is barricaded even turning around prior to the checkpoint leads to confrontation with the police as you are assumed to be committing a crime for not wanting to be questioned you are within your rights to be polite and refuse the checkpoint but the fact that they exist trouble me as do any checkpoints as they are not based on probable cause gary honeycutt 
and youve seen these checkpoints at pm by a suburban baptist church no the probable cause lies in them being near the strip at am where there is a history of alcoholrelated incidents mike 
i lived in the south these things were not targeting a specific demographic as far as i could tell and while not at pm that i can recall they werent that late and they sure could have been in front of a baptist church i could have been naive about who was being targeted i wasnt just waived through once they saw my skin color but my point is that the location doesnt matter nor does the target demographic if there is one they are unjust and just like every other forced interaction with law enforcement does not serve to increase the safety of leos 
if police pull me over because a car that looks like mine just robbed a quickie mart or a guy like me was just reported for beating his wife or ran off with a kid i do not have a problem with that they have probable cause and the risk to their safety and mine is worth it because they may be stopping a criminal stop me detain me for a reasonable time until they can prove i am or am not who they are looking for then let me be on my way 
however ive been stopped in a rural area for making a right turn on red perfectly legal in my state and the officer was a complete ass enough that had i a short fuse it could have quickly escalated after that encounter and talking with the state about why the previously posted no turn on red sign had been removed from that intersection for a couple of months the fact that this officers supervisor backed him up for an unlawful stop and threatening that they could have written me up and i would have to prove in court i didnt break the law just proved to me that some police are uninterested in doing what is right depending on the circumstances that officer had no reason to stop me although i suspect since it was near his house and he is a rural county officer he couldnt control his road rage and by doing so he put himself at risk as well as me there are a million what ifs in that situation not the least of which was the fact that even though he pulled me over in the dark along a fairly rural road by himself he didnt call in the stop which is procedure for that department i could have ended up shot or he could have and dispatch would have never known 
increasing negative interaction with the public is never in a leos best interest for safety and reputation of the police as a whole dufas_duck 
i guess thats why the police looking for a skinny black man that is wearing a white sweatshirt and is  foot that just commited a robbery would shoot a short foot  kid wearing a dark gray sweat shirt in the back as he was walking down the sidewalk at a fast pace turned out that the man they shot was pizza delivery in a hurry to deliver the next order before it cooled off 
police shooting two small white females in a light blue pickup truck while the cops were looking a huge black man in a dark gray pickup truck is perfectly aok 
in the town that i live in police shot and killed a  year old kid while he slept maybe we should all congraduate the officer because he only used three bullets he could have emptied his clip 
maybe the cops that you love are making things more efficient by killing anyone and everyone to save the taxpayers that you are so worried about any money a couple of bullets is cheaper than some cops time to find out what really is going on 
of course some of those evil peoples relitives will probably sue but so what the tax payers will take care of that 
how do you feel about cops who demand sex from some random female and when she refuses gets arrested for your noncompliance 
you would love my uncle he was a cop and really got off when he could beat or kill someone after about fifteen years of bullying beating killing and making false charges against people the force finally fired himmeanwhile he ruined hundreds of lives and they were not you welfare people that he abused it was anybody he could screw with 
but in your mind police can do no wrongmaybe you are right police are always telling us that they never do anything wrong especialy when they investigate themselves or have a friendly agency do the investigation gary honeycutt 
i dont deny that there are a small percentage of cops that shouldnt be or wrong splitsecond decisions sometimes think about how many police officers there have been over the span of time you draw your examples from think about the number of times per day that an leo comes in contact with a citizen that taken into account bad contacts are extremely rare the sensationalism of all these female teachers having sex with students is stuck in everyones mind but they dont consider the huge number of teachers and students and note how statistically rare these incidents are the incidents dont sour me on the entire education system we need law enforcement you are good at pointing out the flaws but do you have a solution will any form of policing be perfect what is dufas_duck 
how about having honest police and policing while percentage wise there is a small number of truley bad cops but there is always a but a large percentage of your good cops will keep silent lie or even cover for the bad cops that extends up through the ranks to the top of the police forces those honest cops that do come forward are setting themselves up to fail and eventually destroy their careerscops dont like whistleblowers 
the example you used teachers having sex with students is perfect once it is found that a teacher has crossed the line even a suspicion that the teacher has done something will bring immeadiate consequenses not so within the police a bad policeman can get away with things multiple times sometimes going on for years the upper eschalon figures out ways to cover for the errant cop at almost every turn even if convicted the court system will come in later on appeal and remove parts or all of any punishment 
for years the public was kept in the dark about the bad cop very few were brought to justice only the very extreme cases of crooked cops were adjudicated it is just lately after public attention that the police are starting to somewhat clean house 
there are child molesting police officers that are still working as officers many are just put on probation others are allowed to retun to police work after their incarceration 
it would also be a boon to the public if we had a justice system instead of a legal system a legal system can be whatever its practicinors want it to be a justice system looks for truth no matter where it points to quilified and absolute immunity for police das judges does not lend itself to anything close to justice 
police are a necessary evilthe are some evil people in the world it is just too bad that many of them are police officers gary honeycutt 
keep silent lie or even cover turn off the tv and go out i to the world some will agree with you but if youd said the same thing about black people thered be trouble dont you think just about any group might share the same likelihood of bending the rules they also dont like criminals in uniform and are just as likely to line up against a bad apple do cops get away with small indiscretions and occassionally a major crime probably but more so than the general population interesting take on the teacher thing i remember a fellow who got a job as a girls basketball coach at a very small rural school he was no prize in his youth and i guess when an equally awkward underage player on his team developped a crush on him he couldnt resist she got pregnant and to add to a volatile situation her uncle was the superintendent of schools flash ahead maybe  years give or take and im a teacher and football coach in that same system at a slightly larger rural school i work with a married couple both tenured teachers probably on full retirement now after full careers without ever being fired downsized transferred or any of the other things that may befall teachers during their careers the hubby is the boys basketball coach and unofficially the assistant principle guess who yep dufas_duck 
ive been out in the world for over  years been beat by cops and then have them later discover i wasnt the perp they were looking for i was only lucky in that the cops didnt make up charges to cover their tails they just lied about what went down and covered for each other in this instance everything happened because i was driving the same make model color and year of vehicle that was used in a felony crime on the way to jail a radio message came in telling the cops to stand down the perp had been caught and identified the cops just turned around and dumped me back at my vehicle 
i think if you would reread what i posted it was the cops that i refered to as being giged for turning in another cop not the teachers in todays world a teacher will be messed with just on a rumer if you as a coach had rumers that you were messing with the kids i dont think you would have lasted in that positionunless you are stating you were messing with the kids and no on ratted on you gary honeycutt 
no i wasnt referring to myself i was an outsider where the good ol boy superintendent had a slew of relatives and even more buddies on the payroll i think the guy in my story shouldve done time and never been allowed to work with kids again dufas_duck 
addendum 
i get the feelig that you are the type that if a policeman makes a mistake the officer should get a pass because everybody makes mistakes police are supposed to be trained on how to back off those split second decisions even in the military soldier makes a mistake and if it is not covered up the soldier faces the consequenses but there are many that think that the killing some kid by a policeman is aok like the two policemen that were canvassing a nieghborhood knocking on doors and a  year old kid opens the door while holding a ps game controller cop shouts gun and  shots lateran innocent kid is dead and bleeding out in his own home while the playstation is running in the background and the cops get another pass thats the kind of policing that you want 
yet a mechanic makes a mistake while repairing or sevicing your vehicle and it leads to a death of an innocent personthe mechanic can be held liable both were mistakeswhy should a mechanic be held responsible and the cop not be anthony fredericks 
theres no excuse for killing a person gary we have laws against that no im sorry brings back people after being killed by over reacting cops no gary accidents like that are not excusable i dont care what job you have soldiers in warzones who kill innocent people are brought up on charges of murder why would it be ok for a stupid beat cop to be able to do it gary honeycutt 
selfdefense is a valid reason and the police have as much right to it as anyone and more likelihood to find themselves in that situation due to the nature of their jobs people like to argue the case of an unarmed attacker should only mma champions be allowed to be cops an unarmed attacker can kill you if someone breaks into my house at night i will do whatever it takes to keep him from doing harm to myself or family i will not wait to see if hes armed or ask his intentions i wont refrain from using a weapon because i dont see him with one it is not a high school wrestling match we wont get up and shake hands after it is decided by score if this same criminal finds me awake and decides to leave at once i will call a cop it is his job to confront this person and resistance by the suspect places him in the same situation i was in when someone invaded my home fluffnik 
i live in scotland where the police do not routinely carry guns mostly noone dies anthony fredericks 
you mean like the guy who got shot in his car for trying to give his id to the cop or maybe you are talking about the social worker that was trying to bring back his autistic patient and the com while he was on his back with his hands straight in the air how about those huh gary i could go on and on but a close minded sheep like you would never see the forest through the trees anthony fredericks 
so gary if i seen you walking towards me on the street got scared because you looked dangerous and i accidentally defended myself by blowing your head off then all i have to say is oh sorry my bad and because accidents happen everything is ok right take your head out of the sandpolice kill people when they think their authority is being challenged not their lives they are protecting their egos mike 
while i wont disagree completely with your statement blanket statements are never correct some police may kill from challenges to authority in most cases it is a kill or be killed split second decision that we not being in the exact same position should not second guess what we should be secondguessing are the supervisors chiefs and elected officials who hire bad cops improperly train their officers and put officers in harms way where they should not be the higherups never pay the price for those under them whose actions they are responsible for that is a very real problem if we want change we need to hold our elected officials responsible for the behavior of the officers that indirectly work for them 
programs such as stop and frisk checkpoints etc all require a confrontation with individuals that do not need to occur that puts officers and the publics lives at risk neither is acceptable the easy solution is to stop making the confrontations occur but you do something stupid michael brown you deserve what you get 
i wish organizations like black lives matter would pick individuals to use as martyrs who were actually victims there are a lot of people who would agree with some of the basic ideas espoused but when you choose the perpetrators of crime who just happened to get theirs as your martyrs you expose your cause as being about something other than justice gary honeycutt 
you can put that example back where you pulled it fromif your head isnt in the way bj 
thats actually standard in every part of the world except usa its normal for police to protect and serve  it is not normal for police to shoot first ask later jack mccauley 
will someone hurry and inform the usa jeeeez its embarassing troothfairy",Fake
"home  badge abuse  genius child arrested interrogated and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock genius child arrested interrogated and thrown in juvi by hero cops for making a homemade clock john vibes september    comments 
irving tx  an intelligent and talented th grader was arrested this week for bringing a homemade clock into school yearold ahmed mohamed is interested in electronics and has taught himself how to make his own radios and other devices he can even repair his own gokart 
recently he made a clock that he was proud of so he decided to take it into school and show his classmates and teachers sadly instead of celebrating his achievement one of his teachers called the police on him because they thought that it might be a bomb 
when the police arrived they took the threat seriously and believed that it could be a bomb as well even though it obviously wasnt eventually the police charged him with making a clock and misrepresenting it as a bomb even though he consistently told everyone that it was a clock and denied that it was a bomb when the teachers or the police suggested it 
the young man was then handcuffed and taken to a juvenile detention center and his clock was taken and put in an evidence room he was also suspended from school and was unable to attend a student council meeting that he was scheduled to be a part of 
here in high school none of the teachers know what i can do ahmed told dallas news after the incident 
he then explained that when he showed his engineering teacher what he created he was warned not to show it to the other teachers 
he was like thats really nice i would advise you not to show any other teachers ahmed said 
he then kept the clock in his bag until his english class when the alarm went off and disturbed his teacher after the class ahmed showed his teacher what was making the noise and she accused him of bringing a bomb to school 
she was like it looks like a bomb he said 
i told her it doesnt look like a bomb to me he explained 
the teacher took the clock from him and he had expected that was the end of it however towards the end of the day ahmed was pulled out of class and taken to a room filled with police officers 
he said that the officers then attempted to get him to admit that he tried to make a bomb 
they were like so you tried to make a bomb  ahmed said 
i told them no i was trying to make a clock 
the officer then told him  it looks like a movie bomb to me 
the police even admit that ahmed never once said the device was a bomb and they never had any reason to believe that it actually was one but the police still seemed to think he was lying about something even though they didnt have any proof 
we have no information that he claimed it was a bomb he kept maintaining it was a clock but there was no broader explanation police spokesman james mclellan said 
it could reasonably be mistaken as a device if left in a bathroom or under a car the concern was what was this thing built for do we take him into custody he added 
they couldnt possibly imagine that a young man would want to teach himself a valuable skill and share his achievement with his teachers 
they thought how could someone like this build something like this unless its a threat ahmed said 
ahmeds father mohamed elhassan mohamed believes that his family is being discriminated against 
he just wants to invent good things for mankind but because his name is mohamed and because of sept  i think my son got mistreated he said 
there has since been an outpour of support on social media since ahmeds story went public he has even gotten support from mark z and president obama cool clock ahmed want to bring it to the white house we should inspire more kids like you to like science its what makes america great

"home  badge abuse  cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party matt agorist november   leave a comment 
lincolnton nc  time and again police prove that the government having a monopoly on the use of weapons is a terrible idea a glaring example of this incompetence is evidenced through a recent case in north carolina in which a police officer shot her own daughter 
on monday the lincoln county sheriffs office announced that deputy misty michelle flowers  was terminated after she shot her yearold daughter over the weekend 
the shooting happened as flowers who is entrusted by the state to act responsibly with a firearm was showing off her service weapon to friends saturday night when she squeezed the trigger the bullet then went through the wall and hit her daughter in another room 
i find gross negligence and the disregard for the safety of others was displayed in the incident saturday night and therefore officer flowers was terminated today sheriff david carpenter said this is totally separate from the sbi investigation into the incident that occurred at her residence 
according to wncn 
lincoln county deputies said they were called to the home at  pm and started tending to the girls injury the child was taken to chslincoln and then airlifted to carolinas medical center in charlotte for surgery according to deputies she was in stable condition after treatment 
neighbors say there was a halloween party going on at the house where this happened 
flowers has been with the lincoln county sheriffs office since  and worked for the catawba county sheriffs office before that 
during this entire situation my focus has been on the wellbeing and condition of the child involved and am of the understanding the child is going to be ok after the surgery this is a very tragic situation for all involved the officer her family her career and everyone that has been touched by this carpenter said we continue to pray for healing of the child and the entire family as the investigation continues over the next several days 
according to the sbi an investigation into the incident is still ongoing it is unclear whether or not flowers will face any charges 
this is the second such incident in only a week in which a police officer accidentally fired their weapon endangering the lives of children last week the free thought project reported on the ohio cop who fired his weapon into a daycare center while it was fully occupied 
despite the officer clearly admitting to committing the misdemeanor offense of discharging a firearm within city limits police have yet to charge him 
right now our law department has it and they are reviewing it to see if there should be any charges police chief jack davis said last wednesday morning 
it was a very unfortunate incident for the school as well as him he added 
outside of skating out of the misdemeanor charge so far this officer also seems to be avoiding the felony offense of discharging a weapon in a gunfree school zone 
imagine for a moment that you were showing off your pistol to friends at a halloween party and all of the sudden you accidentally squeeze off a round and shoot your own daughter 
there are two possible scenarios that would take place the first one being that a swat team responds and you are killed the second less lethal result would be your inevitable arrest and charges of public endangerment unlawful discharge illegal use of a firearm assault with a deadly weapon terrorism or a myriad of other charges associated with sending a deadly projectile hurling through a wall and into a child you would immediately be facing fines jail time probation and firearms restrictions 
however if you are a government agent whos trusted with carrying a deadly weapon into places others cannot you neednt worry about any of those repercussions matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist on twitter and now on steemit share",Fake
"home  breaking news  dapl protesters proven right as largest gas pipeline in us experiences massive and deadly explosion dapl protesters proven right as largest gas pipeline in us experiences massive and deadly explosion claire bernish november   leave a comment 
a massive explosion of a gas pipeline in shelby county alabama  near the site where the same pipeline leaked some  gallons of gasoline just last month  evidences the exact reason activists and native american water protectors oppose the construction of the dakota access pipeline over  miles to the northwest 
one person was killed and at least five people were injured in the blast  tentatively described as an accident  as colonial pipeline shut down operations black smoke billowed sending millions into a panic over the abrupt and unexpected coming gas shortage 
our deepest condolences go out tonight to the family and friends of the person who was lost today and our thoughts and prayers are with those who were injured colonial said in a statement reported nbc news  
cited by the chicago tribune  alabama governor robert bentley said the explosion occurred roughly a mile west of last months rupture adding of the likely crippling shortage of fuel well just hope and pray for the best 
it appears to have been an accident and theyre allowing fuel to burn bentley told wbrc  its about one mile west of where the repair took place on the colonial pipeline just recently liveon  brianpia reports on colonial pipeline company history after todays explosion in shelby county httpstcojjmncsce pictwittercomyntwos 
 abc  news abc october   
refined gas poured from the pipeline as workers rushed to construct a footlong earthen dam to contain the flaming spill where fuel will then be allowed to burn itself out dry tinder from an ongoing drought in the area quickly ignited two wildfires after the explosion  which then charred  acres  and area residents were forced to evacuate without any indication when they would be permitted to return 
theres a large plume of smoke theres a large fire noted shelby county sheriffs captain jeff hartley as quoted by the chicago tribune  were not sure exactly how it started or what caused it he said adding of the massive deployment of fire and emergency personnel weve got first responders entering the area and a lot of them 
apart from the worker killed subsequent reports downplayed the extent of injuries suffered by those at the blast site alcom reported seven of the eight or nine subcontractors working in the area had suffered severe burns from the explosion according to shelby county sheriff john samaniego two of those workers  all of whom had begun digging in an effort to flush one of the lines as repairs continued on the original leak  may still be missing  though that information was both unconfirmed and unclear because extreme heat from flames emanating at the site of the explosion prevented further assessment 
colonial noted in a brief statement cited by a local abc affiliate that both pipelines  one transporting gasoline the other distillates had been shut down and further 
colonials top priorities are the health and safety of the work crew on site and protection of the public 
according to a later report from reuters  the fire had been contained by around  pm local time  yet no further word about the possiblymissing subcontractors has been provided incredible video of the colonial pipeline leak from ryan burtis our thoughts  prayers to all pictwittercomnuodoawo 
 wbrc fox news wbrcnews october   
fears of yet another gas shortage akin to that from the september leak  as well as consequent soaring prices  spawned lengthy lines at gas stations as soon as news of the explosion hit headlines reuters explains 
colonial the biggest refined products system in the united states is responsible for supplying about onethird of the  million barrels per day of gasoline consumed on the east coast according to us energy department data 
further it was not clear whether the explosion happened on the gasoline or the distillates pipeline the governor said in the briefing 
although the aforementioned details handily summarize the facts of the explosion  occurring during active repairs of the previous sizeable leak  the facts do little to quantify potential environmental and health impacts of an explosion and leak of this magnitude 
this explosion of a major pipeline supplying fuel to large portions of the southeast and east coast serves an ominous portent for ongoing opposition to construction of the hotly contentious dakota access pipeline slated to cross four states traversing just north of the standing rock sioux reservation in north dakota 
standing rock sioux water protectors and native americans and indigenous peoples from over  nations and their supporters fear that pipelines route  undercutting the missouri river in several places  threatens to poison the tribal water supply and that of no less than  million others living downstream indeed the colonial pipelines tragic mishap  the second in essentially the same section of pipe in about one month  darkly parallels the hundreds of similar accidents such pipelines are prone to 
residents of bismarck aware of big oils horrendous safety record managed to thwart energy transfer partners original plans for the pipeline to be routed near the city  so etp with assistance from the state diverted dakota access to cross just north of the standing rock sioux reservation on privatelyowned land 
rightly viewed by pipeline opponents as blatant exploitation of native americans  as well as a violation of an  treaty with the us government  standing rock sioux water protectors and supporters have camped along the missouri for months in an effort to halt construction as a lawsuit languishes in federal court 
big oil big banks  and government backers obviously view future profiteering from the pipeline important enough to send in absurdly militarized police from at least five states to combat pipeline opponents  who have remained on the whole peaceful prayerful and unarmed 
etp insists the opposition is misguided and dakota access offers a safe alternative to the riskier oil transportation methods of railroad and tanker truck  but even the companys own records listing thousands of spills in just the last six years flatly dispute such claims worse although pipeline leaks and spills might technically be less frequent than those caused by railroad accidents the international energy agency notes pipeline mishaps leaked three times more crude over an eightyear period 
in fact big oils general safety record is nearly impossible to fully track in part because such spills leaks explosions and other accidents are startlingly common and no less perilous to workers residents the environment  and yes the rapidly dwindling water supply 
a report by the center for effective government attempting to map and quantify crude and other industry spills found not only are ruptures and leaks a daily occurrence but eighty people have died and  have been injured in such incidents in the last five years 
since  over  incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on us pipelines these incidents have killed  people injured  more and cost  billion in damages they also released toxic polluting chemicals in local soil waterways and air 
according to the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration as noted in the report  those spills and ruptures sent  million gallons of crude into the environment further illustrating the imperative to oppose construction of dakota access one of the worst spills occurred in north dakota  not by human error or poor maintenance  but when lightning struck a crude oil pipeline spilling  gallons of crude into a wheat field in  
while the oil and gas industry and its wealthy proponents in government would attempt to pull the wool over the publics eyes about pipeline safety using crafty language and skewed statistics the truth is no safe manner for transporting oil and gas actually exists 
opposition to the dakota access pipeline simply isnt confined to a native american issue as exploitive as that facet is  but when pipelines traverse pristine lands farm acreage and the rivers and waterways we depend on to sustain us were all at risk 
what scant corporate media coverage of the standing rock sioux tribes stand against big oil does exist has painted the fight as limited in scope but thousands encamped along the pipelines planned route  who face an unusually bitter winter  no less  are in fact taking a stand for every person and every creature who would be devastated in the event of a future oil spill share",Fake
"home  be the change  government corruption  not just hillary entire obama administration exposed for using private email to avoid foia requests not just hillary entire obama administration exposed for using private email to avoid foia requests jack burns november   leave a comment 
wikileaks is helping president obama keep his  campaign promise  to be the most transparent administration in us history  whether he likes it or not and once again were learning more about the inner sanctum of the administration and its communication practices as fbi director james comey announced friday a new investigation into hillary clintons email scandal has been launched just days before the presidential election comeys move drew fire instantly from the democrats who claim comey is attempting to sway the election in donald trumps favor while many are focused on comeys actions and renewed investigation wikileaks has uncovered what may prove to be a systemic problem of executive branch accountability not merely limited to the former secretary of states emails 
according to former state department official tom nides in a  email to john podesta clinton campaign manager everyone in obamas cabinet and every white house staffer uses their personal email for government business nides should know as he worked under hillary clinton in the state department from  to  according to one source  
while keeping email hidden from the public may seem like no big deal to folks who simply dont care all correspondence which is related to governmental business is the property of the federal government and is supposed to be accessible by anyone wishing to inquire within the archive of records 
the federal records act defines a record as anything regardless of whether it exists in physical digital or electronic form is a record as defined in subsection a shall be binding on all federal agencies this includes all communication of state agents like the potus who work in the executive branch of government as well 
but the obama administration according to nides has long since avoided the federal records act by using private gmail accounts nides wrote podesta and said there is only one thing that needs to be done on this email thing which i am sure nobody wants to do get a state dept career lawyer to go through all the emails and pull the official ones that admission seems to be on the level with what is expected for compliance with the federal records act but it was nides next admission which is the talk of many major media outlets 
nides wrote btw you know as well as i every god damn cabinet officer and wh staff uses their sic gmail account the former department of state employee revealed what many already suspected the obama administration is anything but transparent just ask tom fitton president of judicial watch his organization routinely sues the obama administration in federal court using the freedom of information act as warrant for inquiry and says the administration stonewalls his efforts at every turn fittons organization gave the obama administration a failing grade on transparency and says his administration is even less transparent than when bush was president 
fitton wrote in   there are about  lawsuits  of which are active in federal court and about  judicial watch foia requests that could be affected by mrs clinton and her staffs use of secret email accounts to conduct official government business in our various foia lawsuits our lawyers have informed attorneys for the obama administration that hillary clintons account and any other secret accounts used by state employees should be secured recovered and searched jw actively seeks out those files through official methods using foia and the federal records act but has been met with delay after delay from foia requests to the obama administration 
while the obama administration is on its way out groups like judicial watch arent going anywhere and presumably have all the time in the world to foia their way into digging up those deleted clinton emails as well as securing gmail accounts from the obama administration cabinet and staffers this story is definitely a long way from being over 
its no wonder why so many free thinkers are now questioning the story lines theyre being told with the president and all his men and women hiding their communications within their gmail accounts the truth is never going to be told at least not the real truth and by the time organizations like judicial watch are successful in obtaining the electronic communications records that rightly belong to the people it will be way too late to hold anyone accountable for breaking both the federal records act and the freedom of information act julian assange we salute you thank you for forcing the obama administration to be transparent keep up the valiant work share",Fake

brinkley ar  dashcam video showing preferential treatment of an arkansas police chief has him scrambling to defend himself for being let off easy  without so much as a warning  after speeding to an offduty job as a referee at a football game 
footage obtained by thv from arkansas state police following a viewer tip shows brinkley police chief edward randle being pulled over in his personal vehicle a red pickup truck near clarendon on friday october  
a state trooper assisted an officer from the brinkley force upon request and makes a uturn after witnessing the speeding red pickup driving in the opposite direction to make the stop 
as the trooper approaches the drivers side dashcam video shows he immediately recognized the brinkley chief of police and laughingly asks where are you going so fast 
randle  obviously familiar to the state trooper  isnt asked to produce identification and tells the officer hes headed for the game which he later clarified for thv was the clarendonmarvell football game 
at that point the brinkley officer who had summoned state police for assistance with the stop also approaches randle  as the trooper tells the chief the officer had been tailing him for miles when he finally called for assistance 
i know you didnt call the state police randle quips to the brinkley officer 
i didnt have your plate the officer replies so it didnt go over 
as thv posits that statement could indicate that since the officer did not announce the trucks license plate number into his radio nobody else would know the chief had been pulled over 
the trio laughs about the chiefs excessive speed and the officer tells him i had you locked in at  
it wont do  itll only do  randle responds referring to a governor capping his trucks speed as he later explained to thv in an unrecorded interview 
after a few more laughs the officer tells randle he measured the trucks speed over  miles an hour  and the chief was still pulling away at the time 
despite the obvious dangers of such high speeds on the narrow curvy road both the trooper and brinkley officer simply walk away from the truck as the officer says dismissively see you later chief 
video captures the last exchange between the two cops as randle pulls away  the state trooper notes he clocked the chief doing  at the curve 
in two phone interviews with thv  which were not recorded by request  randle disputes he ever came close to the trucks alleged top possible speed of  as well as the troopers claim in dashcam footage he had been rounding the curve at  mph 
additionally though the state trooper claimed that the officer had been pursuing randle for miles randle told thv that the officer was on his way to clarendon to get fingerprints from someone at the county jail 
thv spoke with local business owner benjamin martin who first noticed the stop by a brinkley officer inside clarendon city limits 
i find it you know very disheartening that anyone public official or not would show such blatant disregard for the speed limit and put the lives of innocent others at risk martin told the station in a video interview 
i just feel that no ones above the law and you know if it was me i wouldve gotten a ticket 
indeed the public might be lucky the offduty brinkley police chief didnt lose control of his vehicle while traveling at such a high rate of speed  simply to make it to a football game 
neither the brinkley officer nor the state trooper are being investigated for wrongdoing  despite giving the chief a free pass arkansas state police told thv the incident fell under control of the brinkley police department as soon as the officer arrived on scene even though the trooper affected the stop 
as a chief of police and as a law enforcement officer youre sworn to protect and serve martin asserted which is the opposite of putting the lives of others at risk 
although nothing serious resulted from randles excessive speeds it was notorious blue privilege that allowed him to drive away without even a warning 
these seemingly small favors afforded to police by police on a constant basis highlight the divide civilians feel in their encounters with law enforcement indeed the idea police belong to an exclusive club of impunity  simply because of their chosen occupation  only increases tension and resentment in their communities 
if police dont uphold and enforce the laws they enforce against civilians the law becomes an arbitrary exploitive method for generating revenue  and nothing more share social trending",Fake
"home  badge abuse  cop caught on his own body camera stealing money from unconscious crash victim cop caught on his own body camera stealing money from unconscious crash victim matt agorist november    comment 
denver co  a denver cop has been arrested and suspended without pay after his own body camera footage caught him stealing  in cash from a crash victim 
instead of helping an unconscious crash victim officer julian archuleta took advantage of the situation for his own personal gain by going through the mans clothing and robbing him archuleta now faces charges of misdemeanor theft stdegree official misconduct and tampering with physical evidence 
according to an arrest affidavit archuleta responded to a call of shots fired in the early morning hours of october  the call then led to a short pursuit which ended as the car crashed the driver got away while the passenger of the vehicle was knocked unconscious 
archuletas body camera then recorded the officer for the next  minutes and  seconds in the footage he took pictures of the scene and then searched the mans clothing which had been removed by paramedics 
in the video archuleta finds a stack of cash in the mans pants with a  bill on top according to the arrest affidavit he then separates the  bill from the stack and a  bill remains on top 
throughout the footage archuleta shuffles money and rearranges paperwork in his patrol car the affidavit said 
according to the denver post when a detective collected the cash and logged it into the property bureau as evidence he counted  and did not find any  bills the affidavit said but while reviewing archuletas body camera footage as part of the investigation the detective noticed the  bill 
amazingly enough instead of covering up the theft the detective crossed the thin blue line and reported the inconsistency with the  bill to internal affairs when confronted by investigators archuleta told them he would check his war bag to see if any of the money had slipped into a crevice in his patrol car 
according to the arrest affidavit archuleta called the detective back an hour later and claimed he found   bills that must have fallen in his bag after being caught redhanded archuleta then turned in the money 
according to the post the denver district attorneys office declined to prosecute the shooting suspect because of the missing cash and because archuleta allegedly moved evidence inside the suspects vehicle before detectives had a search warrant the affidavit said 
earlier this year the denver police department was equipped with body cameras we now know why it took so long for the department to adopt them archuleta will now go down in history as the first denver cop to be criminally charged based on body camera evidence 
like most cases of police theft this incident is not isolated in fact just  months ago grants police department sgt roshern c mckinney  was arrested after an investigation found that hed stolen both money and marijuana from the police department like archuleta he entire theft was captured on the officers own body camera mckinney has since been charged with marijuana distribution conspiracy and felony embezzlement 
state police also charged mckinneys yearold girlfriend tanicka gallegosgonzales for drug distribution and conspiracy both were arrested in albuquerque and booked into the sandoval county detention center according to kob 
public information officer for the new mexico state police elizabeth armijo said grants police chief craig vandiver alerted state police after the department found video from mckinneys lapel camera that exposed possible illicit activity by a grants police department sergeant

late on friday evening the fbi announced the reopening of its investigation of hillary clinton and her opprobrious emails and the department of justice quickly followed suit on monday vowing to dedicate all needed resources to quickly review emails in the clinton case according to a tweet by the associated press  breaking justice dept says itll dedicate all needed resources to quickly review emails in clinton case 
 the associated press ap october   
both announcements made after clinton aid huma abedins emails were discovered on estranged husband anthony weiners computer come amid growing internal contention as the fbi and doj parse out how to deal with the pressure of a rapidly approaching presidential election as well as public perception the original investigation had been purposely bumbled in favor of the democratic nominee 
however welcome or unwelcome the news of reopened investigations might be one major detail  revealed in wikileaks ongoing publications of clinton campaign chair john podestas emails  presents evidence the justice departments probe could amount to little more than a smoke screen to placate an irate public 
assistant attorney general peter kadzik promised congress in a letter the justice department will continue to work closely with the fbi and together dedicate all necessary resources and take appropriate steps as expeditiously as possible breaking senior doj official sends letter to lawmakers responding to request for more information about email review days pictwittercompcgtodkqd 
 just the facts jtf_news october   
perhaps that vow from a government branch putatively dedicated to ensuring the criminal element is duly punished for misbehavior should reassure those increasingly suspicious of an obviouslyrigged system 
perhaps before wikileaks revealed interdepartmental communications and corruption that promise might have held weight beyond a symbolic gesture of obligation  but as podestas emails reveal its entirely possible this reopened investigation is failed from the start 
kadzik in fact maintains a cozy enough relationship with podesta to have had dinner with the clinton insider just one day after the former secretary of state testified before the house select committee on benghazi last october 
and the pairs familiarity isnt held to a simple dinner party as the daily caller reported  podesta and kadzik the assistant attorney general for legislative affairs were in frequent contact other emails show in one email from january kadzik and podesta who were classmates at georgetown law school in the s discussed plans to celebrate podestas birthday and in another sent last may kadziks son emailed podesta asking for a job on the clinton campaign 
so kadzik  an extremely close friend to the chair of hillary clintons presidential campaign  is tasked with heading the newly reopened investigation of hillary clinton 
clinton couldnt ask for an arrangement better situated to again find insufficient evidence worthy of bringing charges against her as far as conflicts of interest go this takes the cake 
the political appointees in the obama administration especially in the department of justice appear to be very partisan in nature and i dont think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server executive director of the foundation for accountability and civic trust matthew whitaker told the daily caller  
if political wranglings and connections marred transparency and neutrality the first time around it would be reasonable to assume the players havent since magically unentangled themselves from clinton and her campaign mere days before americans take to the polls 
its the kind of thing the american people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of hillary clinton whitaker continued also noting the controversial meeting between bill clinton and attorney general loretta lynch on an airport tarmac in phoenix during the dojs previous investigation 
in fact kadzik as an obama appointee to the justice department beginning in  also initiated the effort to have loretta lynch appointed to the role of attorney general 
and the friendship between kadzik and podesta  as well as their connections to the obama administration and additional officials overseeing the clinton investigation  spans decades 
in  for example as the washington free beacon reported from one of the leaked emails podesta emailed an obama campaign official to recommend kadzik have a supportive role in obamas presidential campaign  particularly because the latter was a fantastic lawyer who managed to keep podesta out of jail 
although kadzik as head of the office of legislative affairs does not have a direct role in chain of command for the clinton investigation he does field inquiries from congress concerning her emails 
noted by the daily caller  in november he denied a request from republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation which sparked outrage by the gop over potential conflicts of interest 
florida rep ron desantis voiced particular concerns about lynchs longtime connections to the clintons in a february   letter  and that obamas appointees are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as department of justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the democratic nomination for president of the united states 
while the daily caller s report goes much further in depth concerning the relationships of podesta and kadzik with the clintons and their insiders it can be easily surmised in even a simple perusal of facts there could be no possible way an investigation this critical  and with resounding implications  would maintain any semblance of impartiality 
when julian assange vociferously denounces the us electoral and political systems as rigged beyond repair these connections are precisely what hes referring to 
it might calm an irate public to hear an investigation had to be reopened  but when the effort involves the same players as the first round the outcome is alltoo predictable share social trending",Fake
"home  be the change  government corruption  prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to clinton prominent psychologist says google has power to control elections can shift millions of votes to clinton the free thought project november    comment 
rt  people trust the unbiased internet search giant google so much it can actually influence up to  million undecided voters to choose hillary clinton for president prominent us psychologist and author robert epstein told rt following years of research 
despite being a supporter of the democratic presidential nominee dr epstein believes googles unchecked algorithm of placing one candidate over the other in search results constitutes a threat to democracy 
rt robert how did you discover that google is possibly in cahoots with the clinton campaign 
re well i didnt find out that they were necessarily supporting hillary clinton thats not what i found at first first through several years of research i found that they had the power to control elections the power to shift the votes so that was more than four years of experimental research with more than  people in  countries 
so we established through some very careful experiments that by favoring one candidate in search rankings google can shift a lot of votes more than  percent of undecided voters overall and in some demographic groups up to  percent of undecided voters people trust search rankings so much that if one candidate is favored in search rankings that shifts peoples votes 
now more recently many people have established that google has a very close relationship with hillary clinton that didnt come from my research that came from all kinds of investigative research by many people 
rt are you going to take a look at facebook and twitter as well it looks like social media play an even bigger role in the elections than televised debates 
re well we know now that facebook has the power to shift about  votes to hillary clinton on election day with no one knowing this is occurring all they have to do is send out go out and vote reminders to hillary clintons supporters but not to trumps supporters that would cause a lot of people to vote who would otherwise stay home so yes weve looked at facebook weve looked at twitter but again facebook can shift  votes google can shift somewhere between  and  million votes 
rt have you been able to find abnormal search results by google in some other countries intended to influence the outcome of elections 
re we havent look carefully at too many countries weve looked at the uk election in  we looked at the national election in india at the lok sabha election in  what we do know is that it is the nature of googles algorithm to put one candidate ahead of another that happens automatically that happens as google would say organically so this means that googles algorithm has probably been determining the outcomes of close elections around the world for many years probably actually controlling the winner in as many as  percent of the national elections of the world 
rt what do you think about this threat of big data do you think google and other search engines analyses all search results by an individual for a good purpose 
re well big data at the moment is a threat its a threat to democracy at least as we have it in the united states its a threat to human freedom its a threat to civil liberties this is mainly because the technologies are very new and new means of control of surveillance of manipulation are being developed which at the moment are not regulated  theyre not covered by any laws or regulations so the problem is that these technologies have developed quickly and we have not developed systems for monitoring these technologies weve not developed systems for regulating these technologies obviously we must do so 
rt youve said that unlike europe russia and china were able to overcome the google monopoly but a lot of people are still using this search engine do you think that the us company can manipulate public opinion in russia as well 
re well its hard for them to manipulate opinion if they dont dominate that country google dominates most of the countries in the world the only countries it doesnt dominate are russia and china so russia and china are protected a little bit from google but russia and china have their own problems russia has yandex china has baidu and these companies can use techniques just as the ones that google is using and perhaps theyre already using these techniques these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides a search engine these techniques can be used by any big tech company that provides search suggestions 
my newest research shows for example that google seems to be favoring hillary clinton in its search suggestions the suggestions it gives you when you first start to type an item and from new research ive done we know that if you suppress negative search suggestions from one candidate that shifts votes and opinions towards that candidate so google is not the only problem any of these big tech companies can use these techniques for surveillance for manipulation for control and i think we have to be concerned about the big tech industries in general around the world not just google 
rt how do you oppose such great power being wielded by one corporation like google 
re well the problem with a lot of power being in the hands of one company is that the private company is not answerable to the public the private company does not have people who we voted on the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous the situation right now is unprecedented in human history there has never been so much power placed in the hands of so few people who are beyond the reach of any laws beyond the reach of any regulations and who dont necessarily have the public interest in mind 
rt what about donald trump in your opinion what methods and tricks has donald trump and his loyal media used in this presidential race 
re well ive said in writing repeatedly and in many interviews that im a very strong supporter of hillary clinton hillary clinton is by far the better candidate donald trump is a very weak candidate he would not make a good leader he would not make a good president plus i know people in his family it makes no sense to me that he is even running for president i dont think he wants to be president i think he just wants to increase his celebrity so that he can start his own television network and i think that steps are now already being taken for him to do that 
the private company might be run almost like a monarchy with the ceo having enormous power and the public having no say whatsoever in what they do even not having access to their internal records so we would have no idea of exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it and how theyre making decisions this is potentially very dangerous 
i made a prediction on twitter recently you can check this i not only have predicted that he will set up his own television network but that he will launch his network with a guaranteed hit show it will be a reality tv show about donald trump running for president and that will be a hit show so i think thats his only interest here hillary clinton will become our next president its guaranteed and in my opinion donald trump has no interest never had any interest in becoming president 
rt do you believe that hillary clinton will become us president through the manipulation of public opinion 
re oh hillary clinton is guaranteed to win this election and i have said previously based on polls that seem to show a kind of a close vote that those polls did not take into account the power that google and other companies have to shift votes thats missing from these polls so once you realize the power that these companies have hillary clinton is absolutely guaranteed to win and she will win in the margin of somewhere between  million and  million votes if we take the mean the average of those two numbers i guess you could say its pretty clear that she will win by approximately  million votes 
rt given that the united states has such an expensive and powerful media industry would you say that voters in the us have a real picture of the presidential campaign 
re well voters in the united states i think do get a pretty good picture because we have so many different kinds of media and people are just bombarded with information from newspapers magazines and the internet more than  different television channels so i think we do get a pretty complex and deep picture of things but you have to remember that all of these forms of media are competitive so were getting one perspective from one magazine another perspective from another magazine 
but when you come to something like google theres no competition theres no competitor its a completely different kind of influence its noncompetitive in other words if youre still trying to make up your mind and you go to google and ask a question about the candidates or about some sort of issue related to the election google will show you whatever it wants to show you and that can easily easily tip your opinion one way or the other and theres no competitor theres no way for anyone to compensate what google just told you 
so this is a completely new and very dangerous kind of influence it has no competition theres no corrective for it and people trust google  we know this from surveys  people trust google more than they trust any newspaper any magazine or any television station people trust information that they get from a computer much more than information theyre getting from television or a newspaper because they know that television and newspapers are biased because they know that people are actually giving them the information but when they get information out of a computer they mistakenly believe that that information is impartial that information is objective and of course thats not really true but thats what people believe",Fake
"cop fired after shooting own yearold daughter at a halloween party home  breaking news  breaking podesta told mills dump all those emails on day news of clintons private email server broke breaking podesta told mills dump all those emails on day news of clintons private email server broke jay syrmopoulos november    comment 
washington dc  in what could prove to be the proverbial nail in the coffin of hillary clintons presidential ambitions an email released by wikileaks this morning  the th batch of emails from clinton campaign chair john podesta  reveals potential criminal intent to violate a court order for subpoenaed documents 
john podesta sent the message only hours after the new york times reported that clinton might have violated federal records requirements by using the server according to the latest batch of podesta emails released by wikileaks 
the email in question  sent by podesta on march   reveals the clinton campaign chair directing cheryl mills hillarys attorney and chief of staff to destroy emails that had already been subpoenaed 
the email exchange between podesta and mills came suspiciously on the same day that news broke regarding clintons use of a private email server 
after news of clintons private email server became public podesta wrote to mills not to sound like lanny but we are going to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later podesta told mills mills responded think you just got your new nick name 
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out exactly what podesta meant by dump the emails when taking into account the fact that this was transpiring just as news of the private server was breaking what this email does is provide insight into the coverup process  and exposes a willful intent to break the law additionally it reveals exactly how swiftly the clinton camp moved to obscure the truth from both investigators and the public alike 
according to a report by the new york post  
in december  hillary clinton  now the democratic presidential nominee  turned over about  pages of workrelated email to the state department but that fact wasnt revealed until the times reported on her use of the private server 
on march    a week after the podestamills exchange  clinton addressed the email scandal and announced she had deleted about  personal emails 
the emails reference to lanny is likely in reference to lawyer lanny davis who served as special counsel to thenpresident bill clinton as well as spokesperson for the president and the white house on matters regarding campaignfinance investigations and other legal issues 
interestingly zero hedge reports that a search for lanny davis reveals a suspicious exchange between clinton campaign manager robby mook and podesta from march   just days after the above mentioned exchange in which mook tells podesta 
we gotta zap lanny out of our universe cant believe he committed her to a private review of her hard drive on tv 
hillarys team was apparently upset that bill clintons special counsel was engaging in a transparent course of action and moved to zap lanny out of our universe 
while it isnt clearly spelled out exactly which emails podesta is referring to in his email the fact that he wrote better do so sooner than later on the day news broke publicly regarding clintons email server strongly indicates that the actions were a responsive measure meant to obscure any investigation into the matter 
clintons entire narrative regarding her private email server has seemingly unraveled and her methodical plan to strategically impede the state departmentfbi investigation by deleting the evidence is now on full display for the public to see 
hopefully wikileaks next upcoming podesta email dumps can provide even further context to this already damning email of course hillarys spin doctors are hard at work thinking up a new narrative to work around this latest revelation regarding the willful attempt by clintons team to usurp a federal investigation 
mainstream media is trying to censor this information so please share this story to overcome corporate censorship and to expose the truth share google  t mohr

asheville nc  a video posted to facebook this week has the internet in an uproar as it shows an asheville police officer allegedly assaulting a yearold girl 
the video shows a short interaction between yearold kacee fleming and officer shalin oza according to cherrell mooney the woman who took the video fleming approached police as they were arresting her brother dominic fore according to apd they had a warrant for fores arrest 
she was asking them why are yall arresting my brother mooney said the officer was being rude they didnt want to talk to them 
the video apparently shows the aftermath of this questioning as the officer grabs fleming and throws her to the ground 
according to police fleming yelled at officers and allegedly reached into her brothers pockets to retrieve his personal items as he was being arrested flemings actions then caused officers to have to deal with her the video is the result of fleming apparently being dealt with 
according to police fleming was arrested and charged as an adult for resisting obstructing or delaying an officer sgt noland brown who was on the scene also told news  that she is charged with misdemeanor assault on a government official 
i have no trust in the police anymore said crystal fleming  kasees mother according to news  she says her daughter was trying to communicate with police before the incident to tell them that fore had just gotten out of the icu 
she is not trying to be disrespectful said crystal fleming but yall are not listening they were not listening 
you wonder why people are running around here saying black lives matter she continues thats why because they really dont think our lives matter because he could have pulled her to the side talked to her he didnt even do none of that 
according to police they were there for another incident but when they saw fore they decided to arrest him too 
the asheville police department released the following statement 
the asheville police department has viewed the video circulating on social media regarding the arrest of a yearold female on the evening of september

ooooh the adrenaline rush that brave heroic cop must have enjoyed after overpowering that dangerous villainous little girl he can proudly puff his chest out after that one nishi 
the disturbing thing is that they actually do that they feel good about doing this kind of thing they are convinced that what they are doing is morally just and necessary reminds me of hobbesto this war of every man against every man this also is consequent that nothing can be unjust the notions of right and wrong justice and injustice have there no place where there is no common power there is no law where no law no injustice force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues jonathan sabo 
this is not about black  it is about getting involved in a legal arrest  razedbywolvs 
no its about black because if it wasnt white people might get pissed enough to do something about it that would not work out to well for the officers involved in legal arrests james michael 
she had every right to require he state why he was being arrested and the officer had no lawful arrest she also had every right to free the man from being kidnapped by a traitor you retard 
now why was he being arrested bruismenot 
what a lovely mouth that mother has no wonder the kid has no respect for the law also it looks like the kid was resisting including standingsteppingstomping on the cops left foot oh well gininitaly 
i looked at that video  times and never saw her stomp on his precious foot she was  and hardly lbs soaking wet youre telling me that a big adult male couldnt contain her threat without shoving her to the ground bruismenot 
unfortunately cops arent psychic and they have to react quickly to protect themselves the girl was obviously highly emotional when she approached the situation one of the most dangerous times to interfere with police activity is during the arrest of a family member 
its easy to sit back and criticize the cop but he doesnt know her intent nor if in the dim light shes carrying a weapon of some sort you cant just go stomping up on an arrest situation ignoring orders to stay back 
have you ever fought an emotionally charged  year old girl they fight like wild cats just watch a video on you tube some time if you havent age doesnt always matter and  year olds are adult sized 
cops dont put on the uniform to get hurt teach your children to respect the law show respect yourself and you wont have to worry about adult sized teenagers being thrown down by big mean cops 
also maybe your device is better than mine but it looks to me like the girls foot lands on his left foot i could be wrong in that ill look at it again gininitaly 
hogwash spoken like a cop of today who needs an excuse to brutalize for profit or the pleasure of being a bully against the defenseless 
lumberjacks farmers emts firemen and fishermen have more dangerous jobs than cops and i happen to be old enough to see my towns  years of service police chief retire without ever having fired a shot at a human being and that was  yrs of drunks with guns broken bottles or knives belligerent mouthy kids family disputes and all the rest so whats the difference between then and now his talent and yours attitude and the desire to deescalate situations not intensify them to the point of murder 
since  and the patriot act they seem to have been given permission to make us citizens their victims instead of their friends family and neighbors that they were once supposed to protect and serve 
you will get no get out of jail free or pity cards from me cops today or rather whats left after the good cops get fed up and quit or were drummed off the force because those that remain are drunk on their own power over people and revel in the violence that they create 
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxfaif_a_e bruismenot 
i didnt say the cop did a great job i didnt say that i would have reacted the same way i didnt say that i thought the video looked fine i was simply trying to give an explanation for what we saw on the video gininitaly 
and just who gave you that job or why you thought that cop needed defending you invented an aggression by that  yr old complained about language defended the cop no matter what the video actually showed and projected your prejudices onto the entire situation in my book that makes you a worthless witness who deals in fantasy not fact no different than a lot of chicken chit americans who think defending the police or government will get you a free ticket off of the auschwitz express you should never defend the indefensible 
all it takes for evil to prevail is for a few good men to do nothing bruismenot 
i take it we cant be friends then stir up the sjws all day long if you must who does anyone call if they get jacked shot stabbed or whatever next time you are the victim of a real crime go ahead and call those same sjws to save your bacon see how many show up and how far you get 
lady dont assume you know me you dont know my story if you didwe might could be friends gininitaly 
i have no idea what a sjw is is that police jargon i know one thing i wouldnt be calling an american cop theyd end up shooting my dog my kid or me if they even managed to make it to the right address in some steroid induced adrenaline rush i dont need those kinds of jacked up people in my life youtheyve lost all credibility as anything that could or would help id ask a bystander for assistance before calling a cop any day 
your words are quite indicative of where your loyalties lie and if you think im assuming then you should come clean and tell your story and at that point i might reevaluate my take on who you are and why you seem to need to defend the indefensible in what used to be the formerly free usa 
httpkilledbypolicenet free_willey 
your explanation is bogus and it clearly indicates that you are the problem the cop should have been arrested on the spot for assault this is what makes all cops criminals they fail to arrest and charge crimes against their buddies in blue you included it astounds me that you guys continue to make your job on a daily basis more and more dangerous putrid ignorance and arrogance and a complete non caring attitude for people in general is what is on display at todays pds this is not the service that we hired you for cops work an entire lifetime to avoid disdain for the people they have sworn to serve only to have pds hire the lowest of iq and then train them to see the public as the enemy once you start to justify the violent actions of todays cops you need to leave the force furthermore you do not have to be a psychic as you claim to see that the cop simply became upset lost control and used violence to assault this less than  lb person bruismenot 
sure arrest all the cops then whose going to keep all the people safe who dont have or know how to defend themselves from the predators in the world 
what would you do james michael 
kops have no duty to keep anyone safe moronlook up the hundreds of citesstating exactly that james michael 
if you have respect for xops these days you either have your head up your ass or are stupid badcopwatch 
this cop should be taught a lesson bruismenot 
why for doing his job and just what lesson would you have him taught do you know him his training or his history if so please enlighten us elropo 
his job my ass i am in complete agreement with gininitaly in my town we have the same situations with no brutality from the police they are pretty much respected here some rare exceptions it all depends on the mayor chief council hiring policies and just whether they keep assholes on the job gininitaly 
thx and glad to see that you are blessed with a rational community good to know there are a few left out there  bruismenot 
ok so you can tell this cop is an ass hole from this short clip you can tell that this upset girl is an angel bravo for you then bravo for you

you all make me sick the problem today is that we raise children to disrespect authority and then feel we can call moral high ground against those that are in place to help 
our youth need to be taught that they are not able to do whatever they want they need to understand that laws apply to them and if not followed prepare for consequences 
the point of no return that i see in this video is a  year old female that feels she has the right to interfere in an arrest in progress 
and before anyone touts unlawful bull it is clearly stated that a warrant was in place for the arrest and as such she was wrong for interfering 
mom is equally to blame filming it hoping to make a quick buck or news scandal instead of correcting her daughter for her behaviour ibcamn

heres an idea dont interfere with the cops when they are trying to arrest someone you fucking creampuff libtard crybabies just dont get it fucking morons think they can adjudicate a case in the streets while the arrest is taking place try protesting real abuse instead of cases like these where morons get what they deserve for being stupid james michael 
you have the right and the duty to stop any sworn servant unlawfully arresting someonethat is an act called aggravated kidnapping and is an act of treason stopkingobama 
you have the right to resist an unlawful arrest they had a warrant for her idiot brothers arrest even resisting an unlawful arrest is a good way to get killed let them cuff you and if they were acting as egregiously as you think they were tell it to the judge if you have video to support your probably unfounded claim all the better

buffalo ny  in their relentless and often violent pursuit to control what citizens can and cannot put in their bodies the state leaves behind a trail of blood and suffering as the buffalo police department illustrated last week this trail often contains the blood of defenseless animals 
police incompetence coupled with deadly training came to a head last week and wreaked havoc on the residents of buffalo the narcotics division of the buffalo police department executed a series of drug raids last week leading to a handful of arrests and the seizure of small quantities of drugs  mostly cannabis 
after the department released their heroic numbers to the press on how much dangerous cannabis was taken off the streets they remained conveniently silent about the dogs they slaughtered along the way 
on friday morning buffalo cops in their search for a  lb  black male raided the home of michael urban  a   lb white male 
while police were ramming the innocent mans face into his kitchen floor urban pleaded with them not to kill his dog but it was to no avail 
police took aim at the helpless dog who according to urban was simply standing there in a nonthreatening manner boom one officer fired but the bullet only injured urbans monthold pit bull named gotham sending him running away frightened and crying 
as the dog is wailing in agony another officer fires a round directly into the dogs skull exploding the innocent animals head but it gets worse 
urban lives on the second floor of an apartment when the second officer shot that bullet went through the floor and almost killed the tenant downstairs 
what just happened urban recalls as the bullet hole went through the floor through the ceiling as the dogs blood is dripping through the downstairs apartment whos accountable 
as gothams blood drips from the bullet hole in urbans floor and out of the hole of jami krafchaks ceiling in the apartment below cops decided to go after her too 
after they nearly killed her cops raided krafchaks home she was manhandled searched with no warrant and humiliated as she stood there in her nightgown 
neither urban nor krafchak were charged with a crime 
the night before the heroic cops of the buffalo narcotics division killed an innocent mans beloved pet they raided the home of cory and cindy meer 
according to meers lawyer matthew albert  meer and his twoyearold son watched helplessly as jackboots murdered their beloved family dog damian a sixyearold pit bull 
meer tells artvoice that his dog was not a threat to officers he is the most family friendly dog ive ever had hes never hurt anyone said meer he would have licked the cops 
just like urban meer lied face down as he begged the cops not to shoot damian again this was to no avail 
as meers yearold watched in horror a cop blasted the family dog to death 
my son lost his best friend right in front of him meer said 
also like urban meer was not arrested however a friend at his house allegedly had a small amount of marijuana on him so the raid was justified according to police 
according to meers attorney he has  active cases of dogs being killed by the same squad 
they are going to say they are going after dangerous drug dealers albert said out of the cases i have theyve hit the wrong houses numerous times  found nothing numerous times and i think at best theyve found a few pills at one of these houses charges i got dismissed because they were filed wrong 
in  the free thought project reported on a freedom of information act request for use of force incidents within the buffalo police department the information was shocking 
according to use of force reports buffalo police shot  dogs from jan   through sept  seventythree of those dogs died nineteen survived 
to provide a comparison buffalos numbers more than triple the amount of dog shooting incidents involving police in cincinnati a municipality of similar size 
the numbers are what the numbers are buffalo police chief of detectives dennis richards said in an interview with wgrz in  certainly no officer takes any satisfaction in having to dispatch a dog 
apparently however they do it is not like buffalo residents have more dogs than other parts of the country this department seemingly takes satisfaction in killing peoples dogs 
when asked if the buffalo police have undergone any special training in regards to dealing with dogs or the handling of dogs in a nonlethal manner chief richards said it has not come to that point in buffalo that weve implemented any of those other techniques 
apparently killing a dog every other week or two in a hour period is just dandy and they see no problem with it or reason to seek out training to deal with such a high rate of puppycide 
something has to be done however and it is far more than just training the most effective action that would need to be taken would be to drastically reduce the instance of noknock search warrants according to an aclu report  percent of swat raids are searches for drugs 
if we want to end puppycide we have to end the drug war  the two are not mutually exclusive matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world follow mattagorist share google  cousinscootie 
adam arroyo still waiting for justice from a  killing of his dog on a wrong address raid wtf are the judges in buffalo doing handing out noknock search warrants for refer with the track record of buffalo narcotics 
noknock search warrants this is the real crime 
the words search warrant cant even apply in these cases its more like an execution warrant 
the only acceptable cause to conduct a raid especially on a civilian residence is if there is a hostage situation 
no hostage no raid common sense 
so a bunch of steroid junkies have to miss out on playing war games with civilian lives well too bad we can call that an acceptable loss mike 
i hope and pray that everyone of these thug cops that shot dogs get shot themselves and left to bleed out in the gutter like the trash they truly are gordon klock 
they clearly get some nonadmitted sense of satisfaction by killing peoples pets in front of them  we all are coming to know that there is absolutely no reasoning with these sadistic clowns the war on drugs has always been a scam to generate prison labor  terrorize the populace whilst maintaining the naive illusion that it is all somehow morally responsible behavior to harm  incarcerate people over such an exaggerated threat more likely to oneself if at all  they really seem to enjoy scaring the helpless as they commit these acts of brutality that wouldve been illegal for them to do three or four decades ago katz ro

"home  badge abuse  parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both parents on a date were asleep in car when cops arrived and killed them both matt agorist february    comments 
inglewood ca  on sunday police responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle parked on manchester boulevard around  am when police arrived they engaged in a minute long standoff before opening fire on the man and woman inside the vehicle killing them both 
in the news release on monday following the shooting police claimed that the woman in the car had a gun scott collins a spokesman for the inglewood police department said that the couple refused to obey the officers commands to exit the vehicle the officers then feared for their safety and opened fire on the car  killing the couple 
the woman was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting and the man succumbed to his injuries after paramedics transported him to a local hospital according to the la times 
the shooting seemed like an open and shut case until the next day mayor james butts while responding to questions about the shooting opened up a huge can of worms  both the man and the woman were unconscious 
for at least  minutes police attempted to rouse them in an effort to deescalate the situation said butts 
after admitting that the couple was asleep butts quickly defended the officers noting obviously at some point they were conscious because somebody felt threatened 
however that notion has yet to be proven and is particularly unlikely due to the fact that not a single officer received so much as a scratch nor did the couple have any reason to be violent 
both of the victims were parents kisha michael  a single mother of three sons and marquintan sandlin  a single father of four daughters 
michaels twin sister trisha stated the obvious when she said that its possible that kisha merely passed out on the way home from their night out 
families for both described them as devoted parents who made arrangements for care of their children while they took a night off according to nbc los angeles 
the police aint telling us nothing said trisha michael after being met with tight lips from the department 
he was a loving father said sandlins sister leandra faulkner all he cared about was his girls getting them right 
of course as is standard procedure for all those killed by police their arrest records were released to shame them michael was on probation for a misdemeanor last year and  years ago sandlin was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in los angeles 
according to his relatives sandlin had a rough life but had turned it around and was working as a successful truck driver 
sadly these children will now grow up knowing that their parents were taken from them by cops scared of a sleeping couple share google  concerned citizen 
perhaps the mother had the gun on her lap for protection while they slept at least they didnt drive drunk these parents did not deserve to die mary hagerty 
did she really have a gun or did the cops just say that to excuse the murders of two sleeping people lying about weapons is a known police tactic to get out of trouble sometimes they go as far as to plant a weapon conscious 
lets say they had a gun how did the police see it if they were asleep hmmm that makes it irrelevant john and linda robel 
who gives a fuck about driving drunk it is determined by an arbitrary number that is extorted by the united states congresswe encourage people everyday to annul this police statist horseshit a felony can be expunged but not a fucking misdomeanor dui get a grip this nothing but a government racket and proffiteering of the dui industry kevin burnett

marie laveaux  im not disagreeing with you i just always like to see some real info before i jump to conclusions not just a headline i have no idea what happened and will not put blame on either side unless i see some hard evidence julie asperger 
on los angeles local news report they said the vehicle was stopped in the middle of manchester blvd not parked on the side of the road both are illegal seemed strange the way it was presented to us this makes it even weirder i passed by and seen there is a large memorial for them to bad there is no video to see what really happened 
cops dont like being filmed 
for obvious reasons julie asperger 
yea i was harassed by some a few years back on hollywood blvd and intimidated into deleting video of them using excessive force on cooperating men i even showed them my press id and tried to be allowed to keep the video they said fuck the press kimberly reichard emerson

as long as bureaucrats are allowed to hire with little or no supervision those who seek to be employed as cops many of whom have a history of being bullies going back through their childhood and who seek this means of furthering their bullying lust now armed with impressive uniform shiny new badge and deadly weapons and with the presumptions that they now have a license to beat cripple and shoot when ever and whom ever they please atrocities are expected to be the norm and will be expected to grow at an exponential rate it is forever hoped that one or more law firms will come into being that will relentlessly undertake the filing of suits and not only agains the involved jurisdiction and the individual rogue cop or cops but those who were involved in the hiring of the cop or cops the impression always being that these who are responsible for the hiring and thus are as guilty as the involved rogue cops  they have to be faced with the harsh reality by having levied against each and every offender hugh awardsfines not just on the jurisdiction ie the city county state or feds    but also against each of the individual involved in their being hirsd    as well as the rogue cop or cops themselves as individuals the awards to be paid by the individuals by their prorated award share payment out of their own pockets and only a prorated share by the jurisdiction as what the jurisdiction pays will invariably come out of the pockets of that jurisdictions tax payers stiff penalties in the form of huge financial judgement awards should go a long long way in fostering an awareness by these who have escaped accountability for so so long of the potentially very expensive folly of this their irresponsible actions which results in so much suffering and many time crippling injury andor death mary hagerty 
i agree but please dont use all caps to write its way harder to read roberto carlos moscoso 
sadly the government insists that they want to take guns away from civilians for only police officers have training and are responsible enough to handle guns yet ive seen more mass shootings and innocent people dying in the hands of cops than in the hands of irresponsible citizens crazy ah tracy walling otis 
is that true marco emilio giovanni maltese thats truly horrifying if so if you have a source of those statistics i would appreciate the link for it i know its bad im not denying that but i am even more disgusted if it is that bad  
ive read that cops killed more than  people in the usa in the last  years but im sorry i dont have the link you can search and you will find it easily i think usa people should be more scared of cops than of terrorists alain vosselman 
im stunned i can no longer believe this this is going to be talked about in the future if we still have one just as we talk now about stalins regime or sadam husseins or pol pot from now on even if we discover new life  triljon lightyears away traveling by megasuperfreakaliesh tech vehicles well still be the most amazing embiciles of the universe aaron beedle 
the fact that there are enough of these stories coming from america for several to be posted everyday proves how messed up the place is i would not want to be a black person living in america today i wouldnt live there at all nothing will happen to the officers they should be sentenced for murder and receive a full sentence police officers over there intruding on peoples property and killing pets killing people just walking down the street or washing their car id i was an american the only reason id want to own a gun was to defend my self against police officers ryan robbins 
you shouldnt believe everything you are reading online its bad right now but its not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be all of these innocent victims are not nearly as innocent as they are initially made out to be when the truth finally comes out on most of these stories its on page  and nobody takes the time to post it because it does not fuel there agenda to spread hate and prejudice aaron beedle 
it is true everyone has agendas im sure there are a lot of people in general dying in america but i know from life that the people with the power are usually the assholes i would say that at least  of all male human beings struggle to handle power reasonably females would be close too when it is appointed rather than earned such as when someone is called a police officer and given a weapon that can kill people with ease people tend to not handle it well i heard a while ago that some parts of the world do not use equipment they would not fire at themselves and they are made to it teaches people restraint christopher rawson 
the police across america are being demonized by a sickness in the system that wants to put us against one another that human is a human none of us our without fault or live life without ever feeling in over our headpossibly there is another way tim walker 
i suppose if everyone voted for that one independentlibertarian candidate then maybe we would have a fighting chance sadly that will never happen the vast majority of people have been brainwashed by the two main parties with the division they have created they can easily put in any candidate they choose how can anyone prove that it wasnt predetermined 
i just watched a news video of this story the mayor said the couple were passed out when police arrived police spent  minutes trying to rouse them and deescalate the situation how is there a situation to deescalate if they are passed out ?? ???? 
ryan said nowhere in his comment that they deserved what happened all he said was that another source had different information if another source has clashing info of course one of them is going to be wrong no need to bash him vanessa white 
some groups must be trying to start to a race conflict and some are just happy with anarchy i would never call them for anything they dont seem to know who or when to shoot or maybe they are all amped up on steroids all the time pitiful i will keep the children in prayer blue thugs 
all cops are cowards never seen one that wasnt a coward and bully one of the cops got tired of waiting and said gun that was all the excuse they needed to open fire what if that was a white couple with a gun in the carnearly everyone has a gun on person or in the car these days what if they have a permit or concealed carry permit do you fucking think the cops would have fired  rounds into that car and killed the white couple well do you if one of the thug cops did holler gun no one can ever say anything to contradict them cops know if only one side is left alive no one can say otherwise better to be judged by  than carried by  that is every cops motto as they know they are above the laws for mere mortal humans linda brown 
chickenshit bullies this bs has to stop i belive all you say as i have been targeted in canada first nations peopledrunk  drive teens and pot smokers are all targets where i live every skin color fair game on last two for sure these peace officers should be heald accountable face an open hearing  open to public   a fair trial  and then deal with courts decision im not sure if this happened to my friends it would not end in graveyard these murders must face charges and hopefully murder one usn veteran

arizona state constitutional provision  article  section  
the right of the individual citizen to bear arms in defense of himself or the state shall not be impaired but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing individuals or corporations to organize maintain or employ an armed body of men 
arizona respects the right of all us citizens to carry a concealed handgun with or without a permit or to carry openly while in this state an arizona resident permit can be obtained for the purposes of carrying concealed while in other states that offer recognition or reciprocity 
castle doctrine enacted right to carry confidentiality provisions enacted right to carry in restaurants legal right to carry laws no permit required right to carry reciprocity and recognition outright recognition right to keep  bear arms state constitutional provisions with provisions 
as such arizona has fewer crimes per capita committed with a firearm as does california how does extrapolate these facts perhaps as arizonians have come to accept firearms as a know factor in their daily lives whereas californians do not perhaps californias draconian laws encroach upon human mental health whereby inhibiting residents of the state of california to live in fear rather than confidence 
i for one shall leave this contemptuous state seeking solitude of which only a truly free society can bring i shall make arizona my final resting place i expect in this forum environment there may be egregious comments to the final resting place  
i respect all of my fellow american citizens and their constitutional right to express their opinions as protected by the united states constitutional first amendment

department of justice has statistics on police killings and being white doesnt make you immune in fact more whites were killed by police than blacks in the last  years doesnt excuse this horrible murder of an innocent couple but please dont fall prey to deluded thinking that being white makes a difference look for yourself

fuck you dude my dad is a good cop and i judge his actions too you are biased im not and leave ppl alone they never bother with flat tires so fuck off chris cochran 
every single one of these cops needs to be charged with murder and the police need to pay to make those kids end up having a good life since they will never have their parents to give them one gary harryman 
yes every cop at that scene is guilty of the same crime since they acted as a gang they should stand trial as a gang and all be charged with the same crime  murder terri spanjer 
i wish people would stop and think for a minute about how the government is allowing police to murder citizens and that over the last  years these incidents are occurring a hundred times a year its all part of the big plan to remove all your rights and terrify you  ps  yes  was an inside job think

black lives are being slaughtered even in their sleep and we sit and watch idol 
i learned at a young age the country will only change when its forced to black people need to stand up we are not shooting practice and we will raid stores court rooms and banks in the s or s if money and property is all they care about 
more may die but we all die eventually and will die sooner if we watch idol this is the world you want to live and raise your kids in really 
this is not hate talk but black lives matter marches and speeches should be the calm before the storm if they continue to kill us and our children in our sleep i dont think talking should be our last effort how many more will die 
it wont theyre killing everyone now desiree m mondesir 
insane i know all cops are not like this but the ones who aregod help them or rather god help the people they senselessly murder and their remaining loved ones how on earth does a sleeping couple threaten you causing you to fear for your life b alan eisen 
i fell asleep in my truck on a very cold night in front of my house a police officer wanted to arrest me for sleeping in it but the night was so cold he got numb hands and left ross thompson laurie choate

the entire legal system is skewed in favor of those who have money no doubt black folks are unfairly targetedabusedkilled by cops but us poor white folks get cop abuse as well but us poor whites dont seem to be killed by cops as often as black folks 
that being said i recently moved to a very rural county and the sherriffs deputies here are standup good guys they are not cowards or bullies that is one reason i moved here b alan eisen 
i wouldnt compare rural life with inner city life at all rural people respect each other they help each other the police are neighbors you can explain inner city hell to yourself ?? ?????? 
in  the police in usa murdered  black people and  white people total killed of all was  
so far in  the police in usa murdered  black people and  white people total killed so far as of february  is  
but more whites than blacks you say simple only black lives matter to the main stream media their mission is to promote an agenda to put us common folk against one another also imagine if us whites acted like blacks when we have one of our own killed by police when are whites going to loot and riot thomas headen iii 
you riot when your sports teams lose or win for that matter percentages sir say that black men are  times more likely to be killed by police than white men i think if the percentage were reversed you would be alarmed as well god bless michael mcmaster 
to put it in perspective if police were shooting people in a colourblind fashion then youd expect that for every  people shot  of them would be black and  would be white or to put it another way left handed people are about  of the population if it turned out that year after year they were  of the people killed by police it would be fair to ask why they were being singled out disproportionally anna black 
whites loot and riot during sports the real question is where is the all lives matter when this happens daniel robins one yahoocom

wtf this article is full of major inaccuracies they werent parked on the side of the road they were in the middle of a major street right in front of an intersection they didnt pull over and go to sleep all you have to do is loom at the crime scene photos and see this article is full of false information they had a gun on them as well catherine durnfordwang 
so for that they deserve to be shot and they had a gun so what again arent guns allowed under the second amendment zatanique 
how does a sleeping couple put anybody into a state of fear for their lives i smell a cover up of monumental proportions by the cops involved i cant believe that they could possibly find a plausible reason to justify opening fire on these two people not only do i want to see a special grand jury called to deal with these cops police department and city i want to see a wrongful death suit brought against them the police department and the city because of these cops  children are without their parents no amount of money is going to make that better or make up for what they did 
on what planet could you possibly justify what happened smh for real 
i cannot even grasp this if they were not conscious why didnt they try to make sure they were not suffering from co poisoning oh no lets just shoot them and make up any story we like huh david sbraga

two exhausted parents falling asleep in a car in and of itself not news hell ive been at work and college and found parents zonked out from exhaustion from parentingbut to be executed like this uh were the cops afraid the parents would wake up and ground them for a week or a stern talking to johndca marible 
these cops need to stop it so were suppose to believe that this woman and this man with  children between them are in a car that late at night just waiting to threaten cops with a gun were really suppose to believe that story i dont understand how cops can be so afraid when they have a license to carry a gun training on top of that a partner and access to call for backup i just dont get it if youre that afraid of a black person on sight then you dont need to be a police officer you need to seek help last time i checked it was black people getting killed by the police and not the other way around yeah the cops have a handful of tragedies but it cannot compare to the numbers when you talk about deaths of blacks by police not by a longshot im getting really tired of this and the whole usa needs to revamp its law enforcement system you can give guns to cops who are suppose to protect and serve but where is the protection for the rest of us jeff putterman",Fake
"i am a rock n roll nigger httpsyoutubegsovftvlrk daniel w mccullar 
as a mix blood american any time i hear someone in the black community use the n word in any way or form i hear and see ignorance when i hear someone outside the black community use it i see nothing less than a disease spreading it is a term that should be nothing less than unacceptable no other racial group uses derogatory terminology to describe themselves using the excuse that you are taking control of it is a bullshit juvenile excuse jay 
thanks for the comment my nigga guy 
although i am not hispanic i understand the slang pretty well and have employed many over the years  
you would be surprised at the what comes out of there mouths about blacks and whites including thouse who come from other countries in south america as well there feelings and attitudes of anyone they consider different in appearance  
we as the white race dont have anywhere near the market cornered as to racial predigest and racism in general just ask the jews or palestinians about that  
we just understand it more from our own little perspective of the world around us but it is prevalent all over no matter where you happen to be at or from  mr 
she said the in n word on facebook bet she dont have the guts to say it in person further more for every white racist that call blacks n word that dont offend us you wanna know y u dont have to be black to be call a n word we as black people use it to insult our ancestors then we think its cool for whites to say it truth be told white people are niggas also u wanna know why well look the word up and u will see we are not niggas we are negros nigga or niggas is jus another word for stupid dumb and ignorance so look at u now who the nigga now um damn shame for a fucked up world guy 
so what do you consider a white honkey or cracker to be  considering i was one who watched the original archie bunker and gladys shows and thought they were great i never liked gov wallace and thought what the cops did in selma alabama and little rock was just wrong  i have always believed mr king was right while thinking that sharpton and jackson are in it just for the money and political opportunities and believe the the blm has done some good but has been hijacked by out side influence that sees political gain to be won on the behalf of hillary who i think will absolutely destroy the intercitys by keeping herself and her kind in power over the backs of african americans and others she deems deporables  mr 
im not racist im jus stating facts why whites get mad when they came out with black lives matters  then they say they are thugs an terrorist how so when whites rally up and sit at the store and everywhere else with a bunch of bikers but they tell the blacks oh they in a bike club shitting me half of them kkk if not all police is the biggest gang of america they get mad cause we sale drugs truth be told the police the one putting drugs on the streets we dont own boats plans for that matter to go get drugs at the end of the day the world is jus fucked up period mr 
further more fuck jessie jackson im from greenville to he aint did shit for that community beside rebuild his old apt complex and added his name on where was he when the police killed my friend in fountain inn sc an took him back to the jail after the fact he was dam near dead then tried to say he hung himself where the justice for that guy 
mr just about every black man woman and child in n s carolina knows that justice lives in the bottom of every toilet in every jail in just about every southern state in the south that the white cracker shits in and calls it truth  
now we as the whites have learned to refine the obvous racism that still exist to the point of having a black president to make it look legit for the world to see  
what do you suppose president putin sees when he shakes hands with obama just a man or a black man  
personally i belive that racism is part of the our genetic make up considering man has been making slaves for many thousands of years out of all races including white and black  
i just dont act upon my inherited prejudice nor choose to pass it on to my children 
i think that is what makes the difference realizing its there but choosing not to act on the difference is what separates me from the others who just make lip service to there ingrained predigest while knowing full well they dont believe a word that comes out of there mouths  
when i see you i see a black man who is just as frail or strong as i am wanting the same as i do in life and just asking for the chance to work for it  
if on the other hand if you are a white or black thug or punk gang banger it dosent matter you will be treated as such  mr 
you right i never said u was wrong one time we both are human we both have and opinion at the end u see things your way i see things my way i know u not racist u know im not racist but at the end of the day can u say u can live in a black community with u jus being the only white people in the neighborhood check this my home paid for own my land also tell me y a police sit by my yard asking me  bout the white guy in my yard and then start to as random do u think its right with out the proper cause guy 
no i dont think i want to live were you do considering i am too damn old and set in my ways to want to besides i dont think my wife is going to want to move quite yet  my oldest son moved to alaska a few years ago with his wife and dogs and they enjoy it a lot both got good jobs and doing well even bought a house on a acre of land for about half of what you would pay for one around one here in the san francisco bay area 
brentwood was once know as a red necked farming town of about  people when i was a kid growing up here my family have been farming for generations the hispanics were our hired labors living in labor camps and the blacks were shown the city limit lines by the police  
my mom was considered progressive and we had a black nanny named pearly live with us for many years durring the summers while mom ran the ranch i loved her much she was a good woman as wide as she was tall would read to me and my sister and made incredible apple pies i first meet her when i was  living in richmond ca to when we moved here in the mid s into the house my mom built that i still live in today pearlys children came to my sisters wedding 
now brentwood is a city of  i dont recognise it any longer but its core is still farming there are black families living on my street in houses built where there were once orchards and going to the schools i did i have a family i would consider white trailer trash living in the house next door that once had garden tour buses come to see the yard and have tea parties  
my attitude is people are people i really dont give a damn who you are be respectful of me and keep up your home and property to show your pride in ownership and you should expect the same from me  we can be friends and neighbors sharing a beer at a barbecue i throw on july th and at christmas and go fishing once in a while in my bass boat  
as to the other thing you mentioned i think about cops being randomly nosey asking about me because i was the white guy sitting in your yard in a all black neighborhood  what fucking business is it of his  if he asked me i would politely tell him to go f off and then shut the hell up f he pushed it there would be complaints filed against him the next day and perhaps speeking to his chief and maybe the city counsel as well depending on the situation  its not a good idea to piss me off cause i not only get mad i get even too  mr 
get mad about what thats childish to get mad cause we voice our opinion my dad married to a white women my uncle married to a white women im white a women an u know what we bout to get married my neighbor are not bad i dont stay in a violent neighborhood everyone stay on my road is family members at the end of the day i ask do u think the police was right for asking me  in my yard im  i know right from wrong also guy 
i am a little confused which is not hard to do 
i think you are asking me if it was okay that the cops who had stopped outside of your yard ask you over and question you about some white guy who was in your yard visiting with you  correct  
if that is right  then my answer is no  hell no  unless the guy is a known gangster with a rap sheet a mile long  and even then there are ways and means for the cops to go about there business to conduct there investigations with out asking people about theres thats why the detectives make the big bucks to covertly investigate with out shooting off the alarm bells  
for some local flat foot to come up to you on your own property and start pumping you for information with out any justifiable cause is against your constatutional rights illegal immoral and he can go take a flying leap off a short bridge  
i know its done all the time and cops seem to have every excuse in the book to want to try it 
but my point is simply to smile at him tell him to have a nice day and walk away you dont ow him a thing if he still wants to push it then tell him you dont have to talk to him unless your lawyer is present  that will usually set them running  
i see too many stories about people getting into all sorts of trouble because they start flapping there gums thinking they are cool and just digging an even deeper hole for themselves to fall in 
cops know from training how to push our buttons and rely on our own stupidity to sink our boat as the results  mr 
yes he did i was asking u do u think he was in the right guy 
damn dude  i was afraid you were going to tell me that this actually happened to you  
it totally freaks me that it could and would but dosent really surprise me anymore that it does considering that many citys had stop  frisk on the books untill only recently  but supposedly it has been done away with according to the courts recent rulings fat chance of that really happening cops will just come up with a new way of doing there thing of harassing people for there fishing for a crime scene 
i am sorry that it has and wish i could do something to stop it  knowing that because of the color of my skin is probably the only reason why it doesnt or hasnt to me  except when i was a kid living in berkeley ca then i got hassled by the cops quite a bit because of the hair down to my butt they all thought i was a drugged out hippy which a lot of the time was true i got slammed around by them quite a bit shot at and gassed a few times then arrested and served time in jail and probation for things that now are not considered a crime anymore  for some of the crap i use to do and the people i ran with i am lucky to be still breathing

never a father figure in my life just a strong willed old fashioned no nonsense mom who drove her father into oakland from brentwood everyday at the age of  in  she introduced me to the ymca in oakland when i was  took a lot of backpacking trips with them to the bottom of the grand canyon to visit the havasupai indians that lived there hiked all over california montana yellowstone yosemite and europe backpacking and hiking should be a mandatory class in hs especially to intercity kids who never get out and see the real world except concrete pavement and maybe a city park  
i understand why you did what you did you will receive no condemnation from me for it  some of the people i ran with were totally vicious animals to the point of wondering if they were at all human or not  hells angels and there buds were some i knew and partied with in the late s while living on telegraph ave in berkeley even ran into some original black panthers along the way now thouse guys were freaky and strange always talking about revolution and wanting to blow white people up  
what saved me was getting the hell out of there moving to a small town in the mountains finishing my college education there later meeting a good woman who put up with my bs and marrying her we have been together  years produced two fine sons that are a joy to us i became a small business man as owner operator of a landscape contracting company for  years first working for retail and wholesale nurseries and other landscape companies to gain experience never went into farming with the family my brother was the one who did that with my mom my sister has her life with her husband  years but to say i was born with dirt under my fingernails and will probably die that way is close to the truth sometimes i rather talk to plants than people because its easer that way and they dont give me grief like people do 
hey  if you want to shoot me an email sometime i am not against it i can be reached at email protected after all this is a open and public forum and maybe you are not all that comfortable as the result suit yourself mr 
im still alive cause god showed me awaywhere i didnt have to hold people for ransom or in a drug trade shoot out all the time he made me realize i was only making memories in the streetsbut ill never think ill live to tell a lot of people who didnt know me my life style jus feel like before some of the whites judge us blacks they should actually look at the community we lived in if we lived in a drug neighborhood it wasnt by choice thats for damn sure we adapted to the fine cars clothes and everything that came with it only thing about it a small price came with also guy 
good to hear now what are you doing  mr 
doing father dutys guy 
so what s that for you  what line of work are you in how many rug rats you got running around your wife work or is she a stay at home mom  whats the town or city like you live in  got any hobbies or are you sports nuts 
just curious is all sure its none of my busies and mean no offence or none taken if you dont want to talk guy 
i hope your education dose not reflect the way you write but if it dose god help us all because you are the next generation and inheritors of what has been left to you so you can build onto it for the betterment of the future generations  your children and there childrens children  to come  mr 
as long as i graduated from high school im happy long as my job allow me to bring him  to  every two weeks im happy my education aint got nothing to with how i shorten my word like everyone else in life i be willing to bet i go to a interview and talk jus like the white people and come out with a job didnt know education had to do with the problems thats going on in the world all my kids straight a students what about your kids are they me speaking my thoughts and opinions dont have nothing do with how i write im not in school anymore i feel i shouldnt have to prove shit to no one but my self and my kids guy 
of course you are a proud father and well you should be dont we all as parents want and expect our children to be better than we were  i think that is only natural 
my sons both graduated from collage and are set in there lives both in there early s one married and living in alaska working as a city planner and the other is still here at home finishing up his education cheaper that way 
there mother and i dint get past a two year community collage degree with me going into business as a landscape contractor  years 
you are right your education has nothing to do with any of the crap that occurring you dont have anything to prove to me and your thoughts and opinions are just that yours alone and who the hell am i to criticise  
mr you talk the way you want and feel comfortable in and i will just listen and offer commentary once in awhile if its okay with you mr 
i like listening to older people it makes me more wiser an not dumb like some american u only have wisdom from being wise hugh culliton 
call me premillennial but i find it baffling that anyone regardless of where they think itll go would lack the judgement to realize that creating a permanent record of such potentially personally damaging actions is a terribly stupid thing to do 
in addition to unprofessional conduct she should also have been fired for such criminal idiocy guy 
i dont agree at all  or perhaps it comes from your firm belief that you have never done something dumb rash or saying something that would be considered even remotely offencive by someone else  hmmm  hugh culliton 
on the contrary  its precisely because i know that ive done and said dumb things and that the recording of such things makes them vulnerable to being hacked that i find it baffling that one would want such personal  and completely normal  incidents of lack of judgement permanently recorded online 
we live in the world of total online or even onnetworkedcomputer collection of data as a high school teacher i deal with this every time i teach teens internet safety thats why i see it as being a generational trend by people whove grown up with their entire lives on line such an environment means that while on the upside we can out trolls racist leos and nasty pedophiles it also means that everyone need to be very very careful with all data and information they store online 
however in this case we have someone  not acting as a private citizen  but as a uniformed representative of the state  in a time of very tense relations between law enforcement and the public taking personal images of a highly offensive nature mistake or not  its out there and this action still betrays a serious lack of the judgement expected from a law enforcement officer guy 
she and everyone else who speaks in public  
trump has been made keenly aware of that fact as the results of what he said  yrs ago is now coming back to bite him as well clinton  
thanks for taking the time to further explain your point and now that you have i tend to agree with you although i still believe that the treatment to this young and naive lady was harsh  
but considering she works in a public tax supported office its to be expected to bad she dint have the common sense to see it  hill billy",Fake
"home  be the change  nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time nsa whistleblower nsa has all of clintons deleted emails fbi can access them any time jay syrmopoulos august    comments 
washington dc  one of the architects of the national security agencys surveillance programs dropped a bombshell over the weekend when he stated that the nsa has all of hillary clintons deleted emails he also noted that the fbi has the technical and legal ability to gain access to them if they chose to do so 
william binney is a former highly respected nsa official that served the agency for over  years helping to create its surveillance program  before becoming a famed whistleblower upon resigning in  on sunday he declared in a radio interview broadcast that the hack of the dnc could have been coordinated by someone inside the us intelligence community angry over clintons compromise of national security data with her email use 
appearing on sunday on aaron klein investigative radio and speaking as an intelligence analyst binney questioned whether the hack of the democratic national committees servers were actually the work of russian hackers as the clinton camp has alleged instead he raised the possibility that it was actually the work of disgruntled us intelligence officials upset about clinton being given a pass on criminal charges after compromising national security secrets through her use of unsecure personal email servers that were undoubtedly accessed by numerous foreign intelligence services 
during his interview with reporter aaron klein binney referenced thenfbi director robert s muellers testimony in march  before the senate judiciary committee in which mueller spoke of the fbis ability to access a number of secretive databases to track down known and suspected terrorists 
now what he mueller is talking about is going into the nsa database which is shown of course in the edward snowden material released which shows a direct access into the nsa database by the fbi and the cia which there is no oversight of by the way so that means that nsa and a number of agencies in the us government also have those emails binney said so if the fbi really wanted them they can go into that database and get them right now binney stated in regards to the missing clinton emails 
when klein asked whether he believed the nsa has copies of all of clintons emails including the deleted correspondence binney replied with a oneword bombshell yes  he responded that would be my point they have them all and the fbi can get them right there 
according to a report by breitbart  
and the other point is that hillary according to an article published by the observer in march of this year has a problem with nsa because she compromised gamma material now that is the most sensitive material at nsa and so there were a number of nsa officials complaining to the press or to the people who wrote the article that she did that she lifted the material that was in her emails directly out of gamma reporting that is a direct compromise of the most sensitive material at the nsa so shes got a real problem there so there are many people who have problems with what she has done in the past so i dont necessarily look at the russians as the only ones who got into those emails 
the observer defined the gamma classification 
gamma compartment which is an nsa handling caveat that is applied to extraordinarily sensitive information for instance decrypted conversations between top foreign leadership as this was 
how interesting to think about the distinct possibility that the hacked and leaked emails are not the result of russian hackers but actually came to wikileaks from an unknown crusader at the nsa itself  another snowden if you will 
let us hope that after for years of watching clinton expose national security secrets through reckless handling of highly classified intelligence some determined patriots within the intelligence community are now working to see the downfall of clintons by exposing their corrupt political apparatus likely we will never know as zero hedge reported  it is the nsa that has been tasked with determining if the russian government is behind the hacks one thing we already know is that when an agency investigates itself it never finds itself responsible share",Fake
"home  badge abuse  leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police leaked soros memo reveals potential plan to use black lives matter to federalize us police matt agorist august    comments 
memos and documents published by dcleaks continue shedding light on billionaire globalist george soros and his progressive organization open society foundations osf due to their poor digital curation however the leaks are hard to comb through which is leading to the information slowly trickling out the latest of the documents reveals the billionaires attempt to organize a national movement to create a federalized police force 
the document shows that osf saw the killings of mike brown eric garner walter scott and freddie gray as an opportunity to implement this mission of federal police guidelines osf according to the documents then held a meeting titled police reform how to take advantage of the crisis of the moment and drive longterm institutional change in policecommunity practice 
the memo further documents that sorosfinanced groups and personalities influenced a task force on st century policing created by president obama last may the task force released a final report consisting of  recommendations recommending protocol to local departments on how to modify policing practices 
the information is from a page report of an open society us programs board meeting that took place in new york city in may of last year 
states the board meeting document 
the federal government is seeking philanthropic support for a number of its initiatives in addition to seeking support to advance the implementation of the recommendations of the presidential taskforce the white house recently launched the policing data initiative to explore how best to use data and technology to build trust voice and solutions to improve community policing the department of justice recently selected the first six cities to host pilot sites for the national initiative for building community trust and justice which was launched last fall to help repair and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve by exploring strategies intended to enhance procedural justice reduce implicit bias and support racial reconciliation 
we are gaining a better understanding of these efforts in order to determine how best usp can use this moment to create a national movement we have already had a set of preliminary conversations with about a dozen key stakeholders and will undertake a field scan to map the areas of work currently underway to advance police reform including an assessment of the redundancies and gaps in work and opportunities for collaboration as we proceed we will engage the funder network we helped to establish the executive alliance on men and boys of color which now includes forty foundations 
us programs usp is a part of osf with the stated mission of working to further a vibrant democratic society in which all people can meaningfully participate in its civic economic and political life 
according to the above excerpt usp was thinking of ways to capitalize on police killings to create a national movement to implement their agenda 
the think tank also raises the question of how to properly steer the ostensible grassroots organizations such as black lives matter to achieve usp goals 
the events of the past several months have understandably led to a wide range of activities including a variety of advocacy efforts to respond to the significant challenges in policing that have been exposed and the opportunity to promote meaningful and lasting change for example organized under the banner of the civil rights coalition on police reform organizations like the lawyers committee for civil rights under the law lcchr and ldf are advocating for federal reform efforts with a particular emphasis on data collection and transparency and as noted above  effecting federal funding streams a variety of other national advocacy organizations including grantees advancement project policylink the center for popular democracy and the aclu are working to provide advocates with toolkits and resources to help their organizing efforts locally based groups such as the ohio student association the organization for black struggle the asian law caucus and the aclu of new jersey to name a few are advocating for specific reforms at the city and state levels another layer of grassroots and youthoriented groups like freedom side ferguson action black lives matter and million hoodies movement for justice are also advocating for specific reforms the range of efforts underway raises a number of questions and concerns about capacity the need for coordination and the appropriate prioritization of policy objectives among others which we will discuss in the policing portion of the meeting 
while the intentions of reforming police in america seem noble the very idea of a sorosled initiative is chilling 
another memo leaked earlier this month showed the billionaire was potentially funding the black lives matter movement  to the tune of  now as todays memo shows we know why 
as the free thought project has pointed out many times before soros has been exposed literally manipulating the world 
earlier this month in an email found within the wikileaks hillary clinton archive with the subject unrest in albania soros makes clear to clinton that two things need to be done urgently he then directs the secretary of state to bring the full weight of the international community to bear on prime minister berisha and appoint a senior european official as mediator revealing the influence he wields within the corridors of power soros then provides secretary of state clinton with three names from which to choose unsurprisingly clinton acquiesced and chose one of the officials recommended by soros  miroslav lajcak 
this is standard operating procedure for soros anyone familiar with the history of the soros open society foundations in eastern europe and around the world since the late s will know that his supposedly philanthropic democracybuilding projects in poland russia or ukraine in the s allowed soros the businessman to literally plunder the former communist countries wealth according to the new eastern outlook  
sorosaffiliated organizations are deeply connected to numerous color revolutions such as the arab spring and a number of other uprisings across the world they have been intimately involved in the coup that took place in ukraine and subsequent ratcheting up of cold war tensions with russia 
as these leaked memos and emails prove the united states is nothing more than one of soros pawns 
while americans remain oblivious and argue over straw men fed to them by the mainstream media the police state is growing  both here and abroad as the citizens are promised reform the only thing that actually changes are the puppets in marble buildings matt agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the usmc and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the nsa this prior experience gives him unique insight into the world of government corruption and the american police state agorist has been an independent journalist for over a decade and has been featured on mainstream networks around the world a classtwitterfollowbutton hrefhttpstwittercommattagorist datashowcountfalse datasizelargefollow mattagorist on twittera and now on a hrefhttpssteemitcom share google  real truth stings 
i think its time to end local policing for profit the police force should exist to protect and serve not to fill the county coffers we need direct oversight of the police the end of the power of their union to protect bad cops and the end of corrupt local government the downside is the federal government is so big and spread out that they can barely keep track of our military assets we can count on them to institute a public facing qualifications search for candidates randy pitts 
do you really not understand that what you just said is exactly what this article is exposing 
soros has indoctrinated you fools into favoring a federal police real truth stings 
do you have a better idea we have localized corruption in every state if you have another way to achieve this feel free to discuss it billdeserthills 
right mostly because obama has been doing everything he can to crap on the police by your thinking the tsa is doing a fantastic job huh real truth stings 
you arent looking at the upsides that are possible billdeserthills 
because there are no upsides except for upside yo head when those even stupider federalized cops hit you pto 
replace local corruption with centralized corruption at least now some places arent corrupt billdeserthills 
citizen oversight cole 
soris is not favoring a national police he wabts rules and restrictions put on the police before we devolve into a police state and we already half way there he is funding blm because they are at the forefront of bringing police misconduct to lightt how do you people not see this razedbywolvs 
i dont like police misconduct but i dont burn down the city yelling kill the jews to accomplish it tracy lund 
what a stupid thing to say razedbywolvs 
does that make you pro burring down the city to stop the  who all happen to be ashkenazi jews az patriot 
what are you talking about  what do jews have to do with this  you and some other people are on this are now blaming the jews for the mess we are in how stupid razedbywolvs 
well that kind of happens when you use a lobbys to buy off every politician in a foreign country and are a big contributing factor to what appears to be a  year old blood feud in the me httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkmvhbrqi az patriot 
typical jew hater there really is no hope for you or your soul  why not worry about the people who are willing to blow you up  razedbywolvs 
would being opposed to a special interest group of saudi buying off american politicians make me a arab hater thats stupid i dont hate jews but i really wounder how you all got brainwashed as bad as north koreans i really dont think israel has a problem blowing us up they sure as hell dont care about us enough to give a heads up when they know in advance that  americans are going to die httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesbbfbdfbeccfeddcccfbeadabbaebfbjpg httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesdaeccfbfdcaecbbddcdbbpng s az patriot 
so you are one of those  crazies who believe the jews knew about this and that the bushes did this to get oil i think you and that other loon rosie odonnell make a one team of nuts razedbywolvs 
are you one of those crazies that doesnt believe official fbi documents i figured you would of been trigged by the brainwashing comment but you skipped right over it and pointed at one the few non jews in hollywood as the problem you have to have a short list for that especially since rosie odonnell hasnt been relevant for  years if ever my tin foil hat is itching the immigrant absorption ministry i think your idf httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoyuoguvb az patriot 
this tape means nothing and you havent shown any shred of fbi evidence you are a crazy  loon razedbywolvs 
i guess the difference between loons and sane people is we read the dam reports you should try it az patriot 
you read into things that arent there go away loser razedbywolvs 
go away from were do you think im inside your computer or something billdeserthills 
sure cause soros is such an honorable guy huh why i bet you think he does this for the good of humanity just so he can get that real special place in heaven that he so richly deserves dont you prince 
local police should not existperiod steve yates 
who will protect us from the criminals prince 
the nd amendment jo 
prince the second amendment doesnt matter if there is no government and police to enforce it duh prince 
duh jo we the people enforce it with guns doodlee pigvirus 
check out  ideas for a copfree world carolyn 
i think you can make a list of crimes in one night that chicago will commit just for a starter carolyn 
mr prince when he gets robbed assaulted in anyway he wants to call razedbywolvs to help him because no one else will get real the constitution states that the states should govern themselves not let the government do it nishi 
i have never been so naive as to think that smart and engaged people refrained from brainstorming solutions together according to their shared beliefs nor have i ever thought that would be a good idea cole 
tell this so called journalist that he cant complain about soros trying to change the direction of our police force before it turns into a police state then at the end of the article try himself to tell us we need to be on the watchout for a police state shusei 
right there is no evil plan in these memos i dont know much about soros if he is evil guy or good guy but least i can say is this article is bs and many people in here have no ability to read understand and think prince 
somebody really needs to put a bullet in soros head despicable rem certified 
dont leave out his son greg geitner 
now its easy to see why soros was paying them to act out ricialove 
as a black woman heres what i want to knowwith all that money that blm receiveswhat the heck do they do anna miller 
george soros is a criminal subversive who has created havoc on a global level and for a long time his crimes are welldocumented he is the billonaire who broke the british pound in  he is responsible for funding numerous revolutions including the coup in ukraine toppling a democratically elected president and moving nato closer to russian borders and funding ngos who were not really charities but subversive infiltrators he is an evil man have you noticed how many billonaire jews are involved in all kinds of evil financial schemes and or hold such high positions in both neoliberal as well as neocon both sides of the fencegovernment positions although they only make up  of the populace why hasnt this criminal been arrested his aim is to deliberately stir up a race war the police are attacking people of all colors and ages yet blm seems to defend black men who were in truth guilty at least they could pick a black man or woman who was actually innocent why doesnt black lives matter defend blacks who have been murdered by other blacks which is usually the case or dont those black lives matter and how about the  of black children born to single mothers with no father in the home often to siblings from multiple fathers these children often grow up to be street thugs the facts bear this out blacks do commit most of the crime in the us and commit more crimes against whites as well the issue should be on the increasing police brutality on all citizens not only focused on black lives the police target them more because blacks commit most of the crime does the truth enter this equation blm detracts from the entire populace of all races focusing together on increased police brutality against the public at large for soros and those who want to increase antiwhite sentiment and race tensions blm is mission accomplished the bastard soros should have been arrested a long time ago and imprisoned and not in one of those cushy hotel prisons either and one can only wonder who is really running this nation when soros remains unfettered dan 
maybe just maybe hitler saw something that the rest of the world still can not see or simply refuses to see az patriot 
what are you saying all jews should have been sent to the gas chamber so that soros wouldnt be around  dan 
oh right your one of those kinds of people huh next you are going to tell me that they really did make lampshades and soap out of jews huh az patriot 
if i were you i wouldnt continue to show your ignorance insensitivity and anti jew sentiment go away dan 
im ignorant bwahahah heres an easy one for ya whats  minus   carolyn 
idiot must run in your family carolyn 
dan you are an atheist who wants the world to believe that hitler did not slaughter millions of jews go to the holocaust museums filled with the pictures and tools the nazis used to experiment on the children pictures taken by the american soldiers when they entered into the prisons so go into a hellnory site and w her with your crap dan 
so explain to me how they had to change the plaque at auschwitz in the s from claiming  million died there to only just over  million and its now believed that its not even  million that died there 
and you dare to call me the idiot keep googling im sure you can find it carolyn 
i did not call you an idiot but i should have auschwitz was only one of many concentration and death camps you check it out dan 
wow you have shown your level of stupid on  levels in the one post good work but i digress ad hominems like yours only exist to show your own lack of a reasonable argument 
auschwitz was well known to have been by far the largest concentration camp during ww with the greatest population compared to all other camps it even boasted a swimming pool inside the camp for its population how do they just lose  million deaths from that camp if auschwitz could not accomodate  million deaths but only closer to  million how did the other much smaller camps process more deaths than alschwitz 
now here is hte real kicker from back in  jews were already claiming the  million  decades into the future its in the damn newspapers and you can freely search and find them for yourself 
care to explain how that happened jew magic i guess httpsuploadsdisquscdncomimagesefadbaaaeddfeefdeedfffebacfbfjpg carolyn 
dan did you read any of the small incomplete articles evidently not m was quoted to show that russia and other countries had that many jews nothing about death these prior years to  were expressing the plight of how the jewish people were being treated now auschwitz was not the only camp that slaughtered jews now does that sign specifically say that auschwitz deaths were just auschwitz murders your damn newspapers need to be read by you before you put that smudge attitude in writing dan 
wow your brain really is broken huh you cant see the connection between claiming the magical  million prophecy which is actually about claiming the heartland in  and using that same exact figure in the lies about ww the same lies that the nazis also made lampshades and soap out of jews 
auschwitz plaque was obviously blatantly lying just like the lampshades and soap myths once the soviets were forced to give up the ledgers iirc in the s it was obvious that they could no longer sustain the lie that  million were killed there and were forced to bring that number down to about  million are you really that stupid that you can not see the pattern here 
there is a hell of a lot more but i get the feeling that im talking to someone to stupid to even grasp the basics 
fun fact anne frank never wrote anne franks diary otto bought the story from another novelist and changed it to reflect his daughter there was even a recent copyright case where they are now claiming that he was the author fun times carolyn 
oh i see your pattern believe that crap instead of what the pictures written accounts by the liberation armies and you did not answer my question on the articles you want to point to that does not say m jews died did you pull all of the articles and read the whole story i would bet you did not you are a typical atheist marxist democrat you can pound your chest again when you check history and find out that the democraps started the kkk group and were the biggest slave owners you people amaze me how you put crap out there that you can not back up kind of like your loving candidate hellnory dan 
show me a single picture of gassed jews or even of the gas chambers themselves or even the several thousand dead jews they would have to have piled up waiting for their several hours in the crematorium it actually took back then to cremate even a single body or you mean i am meant to take the word of the proven lying jews who to this day like in the video i linked above have clung to their fantasies even after they have been busted lying 
as for the liberating armies you do recall that all the gas chambers were in ruins when they came through and there was zero evidence besides the lamp shades and soap of any jew holocaust that account you mean 
and of course it dosnt say that  million died yet only that they were in peril etc but you dont find it a mighty large coincidence you also obviously have no idea how they came up with the  million at the end of ww do you go find out where that number came from the person who made it up even claimed it was completely symbolic and not to be taken literally 
you are a typical atheist marxist democrat and in the face of clear defeat out with the mindless ad hominem once again a clear indicator that you are way outside of your depth you are incorrect on all  counts once again do you ever get anything right 
were the biggest slave owners guess who the biggest slave owners were fucking jews hahaha they owned all the slave ships and were behind every facet of the trade 
kind of like your loving candidate hellnory and thats the funniest go find my twitter feed its full of anti hillary sentiment in fact its the only reason i really began using twitter was during this election cycle to keep track of whats going on because i refuse to engage in the corrupt leftist media once again mostly jew owned for fear of turning into a brainless zombie like yourself 
ill give you this tho you certainly are persistent in your stupidity its no wonder you cant see anything thats going on around you in this world dan 
here is a great classic you really should watch about his explaining away his lies as not really lies httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjswiomiak carolyn 
you really have a real talent referencing things dan 
yea this is how you learn things you take a fairytale lets use santa as an example and you work out when your like  years old how can there be  santas in the same place why are my presents always in the bottom of my parents wardrobe a week before santa apparently brings them to you a week later and slowly you deduce that there is no santa clause and its just a lie that you have been fed while your brain is all still mushy 
or you know you can just blindly have faith that there is still a santa you know like you do even in the face of such a mountain of evidence carolyn 
you need to stop your atheistic info because you do not know what you are talking about m jews killed in all of the auschwitz camps did you know that there were  large camps with  large crematoriums no you did not that is just a drop in the bucket places that murdered experimented on starved gased and shooting of jews k hungary k poland k france k netherlands k greece k boheman  moravia k slovakia k belgium k yugoslavia k itally  norway and k from other countries k jews k poles k gypsies k soviet prisoners k czecks yugoslavs french germans did you know that hitler had built  camps death camps concentration camps holding camps gas camp vans labor camps and detention camps many jews died in ghettos on trains during the death march to evade the oncoming of the russian army and us forces these camps were set up in france russia germany poland and austria one of the camps berkenau killed  thousand jews per day in total m jews killed in killing centers and  jews shot gased experimented on now how do you explain your decision to not believe these totals dan 
of course i knew i obviously know more about the subject than you do like you i came from a place of believing the lies until i started questioning some of the facts i was taught and the advent of the internet and survivors videos where they constantly get busted telling lies made me reconsider the truth about ww 
actually current scholars beleive its somewhere between k and i think its k it might be k died in all of auschwitz while i do not doubt that there was some experimenting america was doing the same thing but on its own people at the time the great majority were simply natural attrition in a time of war considering the allies were bombing supply lines constantly yet never the camps themselves because they also knew they were not death camps in fact lets invoke the story of the holocaust poster child again anne frank if they were really gassing people in some huge manner why would they even keep around a weak sickly girl long enough for her to die from typhus 
and yes of course many people died many of them jews thats what happens when you have wars none of this supports gassing or mass extermination of jews stupid 
but my final question is how do you blindly believe the word of people who have been shown on many occasions to be liars specially in the face of so much verifiable evidence to the contrary ie the lampshades soap diesel gassing vans eye witness stories that completely contradict everything etc specially knowing the fact that many jews chose to escape with their german captors rather than await the soviet armys rescue carolyn 
of course you did not know any of the information i wrote if you profess that you know how many died then go on the holocaust site and you will see that after they checked the records that the germans kept you do know they tattooed the jews to make sure what numbers were dead or alive how would i know why they kept anne franks till she died of typhus they very cruel people the jews were at war with the nazi germans what the hell are you talking about if you go on the site you will see pictures of the gas chambers and crematories what the hell else do you want why dont you go to auschwitz and see for yourself you are so bigoted and i believe you are a lousy democrap despicable rem certified 
hitler has the rothschild and other bank roll him while killing off the poor and middle class jews who hardly dominate their own street block let alone the world as a true socialist he had the pragmatic double standards so many on the left have today az patriot 
you are painting all jews with a very broad brush no all jews not all billionaire jews are involved in evil schemes stop it despicable rem certified 
soros is to jew as kerry kaine biden pilosi or kennedy is to roman catholic soros is to jew like ryan or beck are to conservative or and a better example soros is to jew like oblamer is to christian anna miller 
yes all these people have one thing in common they claim connection to the evil hebrew yahweh  the tyrannical iron age war volcano god happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks just another evil scripture found in your not so holy book psalm  stop making excuses for evil despicable rem certified 
howdy anna i an sorry i didnt make myself clear  i was stating none of those people are believing jews or christians  they believe they are god anna miller

solar power and water desalination are two of the most important things to lock down in the modern age produces an endless source of drinking water and electricity is what we need to guide us through the unknowns of a changing climate  
this is why an incredible project like the pipe needs global attention 
the machine can generate  mwh each year and additionally turn  billion liters or  billion gallons of salt water into drinking water in that time 
it was unveiled at the land art generator initiative in santa monica california 
lagi  comes to southern california at an important time write rob ferry and elizabeth monoian cofounders of the land art generator initiative  the sustainable infrastructure that is required to meet californias development goals and growing population will have a profound influence on the landscape the paris climate accord from cop  has united the world around a goal of  c which will require a massive investment in clean energy infrastructure 
its an immense and beautiful structure 
above solar panels provide power to pump seawater through an electromagnetic filtration process below the pool deck quietly providing the salt bath with its healing water and the city with clean drinking water the design team writes in their brief the pipe represents a change in the future of water 
what results are two products pure drinkable water that is directed into the citys primary water piping grid and clear water with twelve percent salinity the drinking water is piped to shore while the salt water supplies the thermal baths before it is redirected back to the ocean through a smart release system mitigating most of the usual problems associated with returning brine water to the sea",Fake

the bbc has been accused of acting recklessly after targeting children as young as six with a programme about a schoolboy who takes sexchange drugs 
parents are angry that the show available on the cbbc website features a transgender storyline inappropriate for their children 
and concerned campaigners said it could sow the seeds of confusion in young minds the programme just a girl depicts an yearolds struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty making it easier to have sexchange surgery in the future 
one mother writing on the mumsnet website said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video she said her girl who likes wearing boys clothes and playing football had asked me anxiously if that means she was a boy 
tory mp peter bone said it beggars belief that the bbc is making this programme freely available to children as young as six i entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children 
it is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the cbbc website and i shall be writing to bbc bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible 
former culture secretary maria miller voiced her concerns over the bbc tackling the subject in an ageappropriate way saying such issues should be raised where children can have support from parents 
and tory mp julian brazier said this programme is very disappointing and inappropriate children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them 
family campaigner norman wells said it is irresponsible of the bbc to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex 
just a girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself amy and dresses as a girl it is hosted on the cbbc website aimed at children aged between six and  
in the halfhour programme amy  played by an actress  reveals she was born a boy called ben but has already started using pubertyhalting drugs 
such hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when the mail on sunday revealed an nhs clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine 
critics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery with many realising they are gay the bbc row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues fuelled by a number of highprofile cases in one a christian couple were threatened with having their yearold daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy 
in another a sevenyearold boy was ordered to be removed from his mothers care as she was raising him as female causing him a great deal of emotional harm 
in just a girl amy says when i was born mum said dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football but mum knew i was different she realised early on that i was born in the wrong body 
she adds my mum supported me when i did a powerpoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that i wasnt going to come to school in boys clothes any more but girls clothes i wasnt ben i was amy 
later amy is shown telling a friend josh  a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl  that she is on hormone blockers saying it took ages to get them after loads of tests and talks at the clinic once they realised i was trans for real i got them she says in another entry amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called liam but confides liam thinks im just a girl but im not im trans and whats he going to say if he finds out stop being my friend why im still me arent i 
child psychotherapist dr dilys daws said the programme could confuse children she said that while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex the bbc was irresponsible to feature the extreme step of gender change for sixyearolds because they were too young to grapple with such issues 
the programme generated hundreds of comments on mumsnet 
one mother who said her sevenyearold had watched the show asked am i being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group 
another replied dont think this is remotely suitable for a sevenyearold to start suggesting that children can be transgender when theyre far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging a small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible that sometime in the future hell wake up with a girls body 
another user added i dont think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than yearolds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised 
other critics slammed the bbc mr wells director of the family education trust said the more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girls body and a girl can be born into a boys body and that drugs and surgery can put things right the more children will become utterly confused respecting and preserving a childs birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue 
but some parents on mumsnet were more positive one wrote i dont believe there is too young for stuff like this the earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is normal the better 
dr polly carmichael a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children said raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues programmes like just a girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion 
the bbc said just a girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends which are universal themes that many children relate to and which has had a positive response from our audience

"cyrus mistry joins aap tata sons shortlists candidates for chairmans post posted on tweet image via intodayin 
ousted chairman of tata sons cyrus mistry today joined the aam aadmi party speaking to the media cyrus mistry said the media government regulators or politicians no one is supporting me in fighting against the injustice i have faced kejriwalji is my only hope so i joined the aap 
speaking at the occasion aap supremo and delhi cm arvind kejriwal said having worked at tata steel several years ago i have firsthand experience of how the board of directors of tata sons did not allow me to work that is the reason i quit tata steel 
just like cyrus mistry i also took up the top job in delhi because there were no other suitable candidate i empathize with cyrus mistry when he says that ratan tata did not allow him to do work in a similar way narendra modi and najeeb jung do not allow me to do work in delhi he added 
why should someone be fired for choosing to close loss making uk steel business first take care of indians before subsidizing british citizens ratan tata is a british agent even aap does not fire its leaders so fast he declared 
meanwhile our correspondent overheard this discussion between cyrus mistry and rajdeep sardesai 
rajdeep sardesai so what i understand mr mistry is that you are concerned about the rising intolerance by the majority against the minorities in india 
cyrus mistry no i only said that i am concerned about the rising intolerance of the majority shareholders in tata sons against minority shareholders like me 
meanwhile aap leader ashutosh took to twitter to blast tata sons 
as per cyrus mistry tata motors nano plant in gujarat is making losses even industrialists in gujarat are losing money is this the gujarat model will modi answer he tweeted 
cyrus mistry spoke about risk of impairment in tata steal will ratan tata answer read his second tweet 
why was cyrus mistry not given a free hand to run tata suns will the bored answer said his third tweet 
a source who did not wish to be identified told our correspondent that tata sons is also planning to fire cyrus mistry from the board of directors and has already found his replacement 
after ratan tata asked for a versatile candidate with expertise in several fields and who is not afraid to speak his mind a consultant suggested the name of justice katju but ratan tata was not pleased at the prospect of being called an idiot in a board meeting and so vetoed the proposal instead congress leader ahmed patel will be filling this post 
according to our source the tata sons board was very impressed with ahmed patel after he told them that rather than abrupt firing they should have kept planting stories in the media like ratan tata unhappy with cyrus mistrys decision to close down tata steel uk business 
this along with his ability to effectively manage a family trust and also manage a professional ceo without letting him drift from the groups ethos and culture earned him a board seat 
further according to our source several names came up during the latest board meeting to pick a new chairman ahmed patel suggested the name of dr manmohan singh but ratan tata vetoed it saying he wanted a person who could be a brand ambassador for the tata group 
currently there are  persons who are frontrunners in the race for chairman one is arvind kejriwal several board members think that he will be a suitable candidate because he can just give speeches visit offices and be a brand ambassador while the actual work could be left to the board 
another name doing the round is chetan bhagat given his iit iim qualifications along with his versatile persona of being an author columnist screenwriter television personality and motivational speaker several board members think he is the perfect candidate for the heavily diversified salt to software conglomerate further he is good with numbers an area the tata group is struggling at this point in time",Fake

julian assange claims that hillary clintons campaign used hackers to attack wikileaks servers wikileaks editorinchief says that despite the ecuadorian embassy shutting down its internet to stop accusations of interference in us elections his organisation will keep on publishing until the elections are over 
via yournewswire sponsored links 
everyday that you publish is a day that you have the initiative in the conflict assange said via telephone at a conference in argentina on wednesday scroll down for video below 
the whistleblowing website has been releasing emails from clintons campaign chair john podesta on a daily basis since early october assange claimed the release whipped up a crazed hornets nest atmosphere in the hillary clinton campaign leading them to attack wikileaks 
they attacked our servers and attempted hacking attacks and there is an amazing ongoing campaign where state documents were put in the un and british courts to accuse me of being both a russian spy and a pedophile he added 
ecuadors decision to shut down his internet was described by assange as a strategic position so that its policy of nonintervention cant be misinterpreted by actors in the us and even domestically in ecuador he said he was sympathetic with ecuador insisting they face the dilemma of having the us interfere with their elections next year if they appear to interfere with the us elections next month more wikileaks has activated contingency plans after assange s internet link was intentionally cut off httpstcooctsmseme 
 rt rt_com october   
assange who claimed the embassy will be without internet until the election is over to avoid accusations of interference said he did not agree with ecuadors decision but did understand it wikileaks will not be affected by the decision as they do not publish from ecuador he said 
he did however reject the idea that wikileaks is interfering with the us election claiming this is not the interference of electoral process this is the definition of electoral process  for media organizations and in fact everyone to publish the truth and their opinion about what is occurring it cannot be a free and informed election unless people are free to inform 
he also attacked us tv networks many of whom he accused of being controlled by clinton supporters we were fastest on podestaemails  faster than wikileaks  and the us conspiracy machine cant handle it httpstconjaaeqdd 
 rt rt_com october   
the podesta emails will make no difference to the election result according to assange i dont think theres any chance of donald trump winning the election even with the amazing material we are publishing because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with hillary clinton he said 
assange said journalists and people who work in the media are predominantly middle class and view trump as representing what in their mind is white trash",Fake
"its the sort of story that only feeds existing suspicions that the upcoming presidential election is being rigged to install hillary clinton in the white house regardless of the true vote count 
via truthandaction 

it strikes directly at the heart of the integrity of our election process and has the potential to cast doubt on the legitimacy of candidates who are declared the winners the story in question appeared on the infowars website and while some of the details cannot be confirmed its worth a look 


elections in the united states do not have a perfect record of being free from attempts to manipulate the results through fraud as reprehensible as that may be its not entirely unexpected considering whats at stake aggressive efforts to insure the integrity of our elections and the prosecution of those who would corrupt them are essential to giving the winning candidates the legitimacy they deserve
all of this has the potential to go out the window this year as accusations of voter fraud through the manipulation of the counting of the ballots are already rampant
a recent story appearing on the infowars news site claims to show that one tv station is already preparing to announce a clinton victory
a nbc station was caught posting election results showing a hillary clinton victory days before the election fueling concerns that the mainstream media is conditioning the public to accept a rigged election favoring hillary
political activists discovered a hidden web site for wrcb out of chattanooga tenn showing election results with hillary clinton securing  electoral votes and  of the popular vote
the web site originated from the ftp server of worldnow a media software company that provides realtime data  such as election results  and other media assets to local news stations
its important to note that although infowars claims that the site is a hidden site for wrcb we at truth and action could not independently verify this  note that infowars states that this hidden web site is located in chattanooga tennessee a search of the domain name returns ohio as the location where the domain name was registered although that is not conclusive either as to the actual location where the site is maintained
even with these doubts about the authenticity of the web site under discussion this news will do nothing to instill confidence but will be one more factor furthering the suspicion and lack of trust surrounding the integrity of this years presidential election
in fact it dovetails nicely with the fractional method of counting the votes previously reported
election fraud expert bev harris was the first to uncover this method which is also known as vote shaving
you need to have votes counted as fractions harris said on the alex jones show monday you need the votes to be counted with decimal places like you count money
if a vote is a dollar you also need to have cents with it that will not show its hidden
vote shaving works by treating votes as decimals rather than whole numbers which allows the machines to allocate the remaining fractional percentages elsewhere to sway election outcomes
theres this one central computer which at the end of the day all the votes come to it harris pointed out thats where you take it you dont run around to  different precincts you wait until the votes come to you and then you have your way with them
all of this is incredibly troubling one ray of hope is that if there really is a concerted effort to rig the vote for hillary that the trump campaign is vigilant and prepared to take all legal measures to expose any vote fraud and insure that the ballots are counted accurately resulting in a decision that truly does represent the will of the people

"by gordon duff senior editor on october   radio host and trump supporter claims jewish mafia controls us 
editors note the insanity has hit trump mouthpiece and arch zionist alex jones is on the warpath against the jewish mob israels newspapers are shocked as you can see below  or are they trump grandson of a brothel owner son of a slum lord grew up in meyer lanskys mobrun new york and by his s became the ingenuemoney boy of jewish mob kingpin roy cohn it was roy cohn and the jewish mob that built trumps empire and ran interference for him with the gambinos john gotti  company now covering this up seems to be really important but to whom and why 
the article below was published in todays jerusalem post not a word of it is true moreover it is an obvious deflection piece written to save trumps nazi supporters backing in face of vts slam dunk assertions of trumps zionist fanaticism 
after all trump has pushed for war on iran for clearing out the west bank and for a one state solution in israel with palestinians going through the chimneys 
but why then are americas jew haters the human filth that would gas americas jews the big trump lovers some of it comes from the nazi movement itself largely begun as a fundraiser by the adljdlaipacsplc lobby you see no swastikas painted on synagogues no big corporate donations on alex jones by brother nathaniel  a long accused rabid antizionist 
the controversy of alex bullhorn jones being an alleged zionist shill has now expanded to his apparent zionistjewish connections on his  personal staff  website advertisers  link to time warner president edgar bronfman jr 
jones seeming allegiance to zionism which explains why he virtually never targets zionist jews or the racist zionist rogue state of israel when engaging in his notorious rants and attacks  may well stem from a protestantzionist belief system and the widely circulated reports that his wife is a jew  which makes his two children jewish under talmudic law and eligible for the israeli law of return  
with additional information on jones which this site is now providing alex jones zionist connections prompting his reticence to expose global zionism becomes ever more obvious 
trump has played the hate card from day one building his base on hatred of blacksafrican americans messicans and of course he has played the terror card the yellow hordes card and the elite liberal card as well 
that one is aimed at the jews trump whose empire was built by roy cohn and who has been supported and financed by jewish organized crime and now by vegas boss shelly adelson who can buy and sell trump out of his trump change has always been a front for the jewish mob jewish mobsters as oft pointed out by ian greenhalgh have surrounded trump and embarrassed him if you can imagine that more than once 
years ago during nasty litigation radio host jeff rense former partner of alex jones tracked jones and his backing to the jewish mob and the bronfman crime family accused of their complicity in financing  
now we see the zionist press pulling out the antisemite card on alex jones one of israels strongest supporters in the us is this a joke of course this kind of childishness would only work with the brain dead jew hating nazis that have flocked to trump with trumps effusive love of everything israel and everything zionist one might ask why the nazis flock to him but nazis have never been thinkers and are great followers even when they are sent over a cliff like lemmings 
comment boards at vt have been inundated with paid trolls some who track back to israel others employed by trump surrogate operations tied to his campaign toads and trolls get up to  for a comment placed even on wrong articles thus we have closed comments to cut off this income source and clean out the trash were we can even though this is the best money trump pays out except for hookers 
when are american jews going to rise off their knees and hit back at well at israel the adl and the rising tide of naziism in the us paid for by their donations

"los brics plantan cara a la guerra financiera de estados unidos por ariel noyola rodrÃ­guez para hacer frente a la guerra financiera de estados unidos es urgente que los brics fortalezcan sus vÃ­nculos de cooperaciÃ³n en los Ã¡mbitos de la economÃ­a y las finanzas el nuevo banco de desarrollo de los brics debe aumentar su volumen de crÃ©ditos lo mismo el acuerdo contingente de reservas adicionalmente los brics deben poner en marcha lo mÃ¡s pronto posible su propia agencia de calificaciÃ³n para intensificar su cohesiÃ³n econÃ³mica la implementaciÃ³n de un Ã¡rea de libre comercio echarÃ­a abajo las barreras arancelarias y con ello incrementarÃ­a sustancialmente los intercambios comerciales entre ellos en definitiva si no se toman cuanto antes las medidas pertinentes los brics corren el riesgo de naufragar durante el prÃ³ximo huracÃ¡n financiero
red voltaire  ciudad de mÃ©xico mÃ©xico   de octubre de  franÃ§ais ??????? italiano el  y  de octubre se llevÃ³ a cabo en el estado de goa india la octava cumbre de los brics acrÃ³nimo de brasil rusia india china y sudÃ¡frica hay que reconocer que el encuentro se desarrollÃ³ en medio de una situaciÃ³n profundamente crÃ­tica para la economÃ­a mundial sin embargo los brics pusieron de manifiesto una vez mÃ¡s su extraordinaria capacidad para transformar un mal momento en una oportunidad para profundizar los vÃ­nculos entre ellos desde una perspectiva estratÃ©gica
despuÃ©s de que las economÃ­as de los brics gozaran de una Ã©poca dorada en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os sus tasas de crecimiento han sufrido una drÃ¡stica desaceleraciÃ³n frente a esta difÃ­cil coyuntura hoy mÃ¡s que nunca los brics necesitan echar mano de las instituciones financieras que presentaron ante el mundo hace un par de aÃ±os en fortaleza brasil durante su sexta cumbre   
en abril pasado su nuevo banco de desarrollo realizÃ³ sus primeros prÃ©stamos    por mÃ¡s de  millones de dÃ³lares y para  se calcula que los crÃ©ditos otorgados podrÃ­an alcanzar los   millones de dÃ³lares    asimismo esta entidad financiera llevÃ³ a cabo en julio de este aÃ±o una histÃ³rica emisiÃ³n de bonos verdes green bonds en yuanes por un monto equivalente a  millones de dÃ³lares    estos tÃ­tulos financieros a la vez que incrementan la influencia de la moneda china a escala mundial sirven para el financiamiento de grandes proyectos de inversiÃ³n
por su parte el acuerdo contingente de reservas cra por sus siglas en inglÃ©s dotado de   millones de dÃ³lares ya estÃ¡ listo para otorgar sus primeras lÃ­neas de crÃ©dito con el objetivo de estabilizar las balanzas de pagos de los brics segÃºn anunciÃ³ el ministro de finanzas de la india arun jaitley    toda vez que la reserva federal fed de estados unidos amaga permanentemente con subir la tasa de interÃ©s de los fondos federales federal funds rate y con ello detonar una nueva turbulencia financiera mundial urge que los brics incrementen cuanto antes los recursos monetarios de su fondo de estabilizaciÃ³n pues de lo contrario corren el riesgo de padecer serios estragos por las apuestas especulativas de los grandes bancos de inversiones
de forma simultÃ¡nea los brics necesitan abrir nuevos frentes de batalla que desafÃ­en de modo abierto la hegemonÃ­a de estados unidos y el dÃ³lar en el sistema financiero mundial    no solamente a travÃ©s de los intercambios comerciales en monedas locales sino por ejemplo a travÃ©s de la acumulaciÃ³n de reservas en yuanes entre sus bancos centrales mÃ¡s todavÃ­a luego de que la moneda del pueblo renminbi en chino ingresÃ³ oficialmente el pasado Âº de octubre en los derechos especiales de giro special drawing rights la canasta de divisas de Ã©lite creada por el fondo monetario internacional fmi a finales de la dÃ©cada de los    
por aÃ±adidura los brics tienen la capacidad de articular una gran alianza financiera con poderosos eslabonamientos geopolÃ­ticos entre amÃ©rica latina asia Ã¡frica y el medio oriente los bancos regionales de desarrollo que estÃ¡n conformados en su mayorÃ­a por los paÃ­ses perifÃ©ricos bien pueden servir a este objetivo el banco asiÃ¡tico de inversiones en infraestructura aiib por sus siglas en inglÃ©s el banco del alba alianza bolivariana para los pueblos de nuestra amÃ©rica e incluso el banco del sur que finalmente arrancarÃ¡ antes de que termine este aÃ±o
asimismo se ha vuelto una imperiosa exigencia para los brics la puesta en marcha de una agencia de calificaciÃ³n propia que rompa con el predominio aplastante que estados unidos mantiene a travÃ©s de fitch moodys y standard  poors   
 estas tres agencias de calificaciÃ³n mÃ¡s que realizar evaluaciones que se guÃ­en por criterios de tipo tÃ©cnico actÃºan fundamentalmente bajo impulsos de carÃ¡cter polÃ­tico esto es como autÃ©nticas mÃ¡quinas de guerra degradan las notas de los bonos de deuda soberana y con ello elevan dramÃ¡ticamente los costos de financiamiento de paÃ­ses como grecia rusia o venezuela
la cohesiÃ³n econÃ³mica es otro de los grandes retos si bien es indudable que se ha venido intensificando de forma sustantiva durante los aÃ±os recientes entre  y  el comercio entre los brics como proporciÃ³n de sus intercambios totales se duplicÃ³ del  al     china es por mucho la economÃ­a que estÃ¡ mÃ¡s integrada con los demÃ¡s brics en contraste los vÃ­nculos entre paÃ­ses como la india y sudÃ¡frica son marginales lo mismo sucede entre brasil y rusia por eso es muy pertinente la prÃ³xima implementaciÃ³n de un Ã¡rea de libre comercio entre los brics    sin embargo ademÃ¡s de echar abajo las barreras arancelarias entre ellos los brics necesitan promover la construcciÃ³n de cadenas de valor de forma conjunta esto es integrar sus aparatos productivos para incentivar la industrializaciÃ³n de las economÃ­as menos aventajadas
en conclusiÃ³n son muchos los desafÃ­os en el horizonte para estas cinco potencias emergentes estoy convencido de que en lo sucesivo el Ã©xito de los brics dependerÃ¡ de la capacidad que tengan para reinventarse de su creatividad para articular nuevas dimensiones de cooperaciÃ³n con vistas a cumplir metas de mÃ¡s largo alcance frente a la nueva guerra financiera que prepara estados unidos es momento de que los brics vuelvan a la carga

why i wont vote for hillary clinton  evan edinger but then he changes his mind on that to close evan edlinger will vote for hillary against trump because he thinks that whereas hillarys actual trackrecord of policies not mere statements in public office have been horrific trumps bad statements and lack of any trackrecord in public office at all make trump even worse thats what he thinks i think it makes trump better  the better choice  as opposed to the proven evil and catastrophically harmful public official hillary clinton edlinger is preferring an evil record as a public official to no record as a public official edlinger fails to make two crucial distinctions one is that he fails to distinguish between mere political statements versus actual political policies carried out as a public official which show hillary to be a proven neocon and tool of wall street and the other is his failing to distinguish between a bad record in a persons private or business affairs versus a bad record as an actual public official only the bad record as a public official should be absolutely disqualifying  and thats clinton not trump who has a horrific record as a public official trump has no record at all as a public official edlinger at  in his video says that when he contemplates voting for hillarytheres always one thing that comes in the way and thats trust he says he doesnt trust her  but what he doesnt actually trust is her words when he says hell vote for her hes simply ignoring her actions hes ignoring the real personasapublicofficial the person who is shown and displayed beyond any reasonable doubt whatsoever proven selfishness in ones private life is bad but proven selfishness and evil in ones publicoffice policies such as we came we saw he died ha ha  is utterly disqualifying i argued in my im a bernie sanders voter heres why ill vote trump  that trump could possibly turn out to be a progressive president but even if he turns out to be a bad president he wont on balance be as horrific as will a president hillary clinton with trump there is reason to have some hope for the future of the world with clinton there is reason to expect unprecedented horrors,Fake

picture if you will video footage of vintage early  donald trump buffoonery with the ceo of cbs leslie moonves commenting on major medias choice to give trump vastly more air time than other candidates it may not be good for america but its damn good for cbs 
thats the introduction to a powerful critique of the us media a new film screens in new york and los angeles this week called all governments lie truth deception and the spirit of if stone  
the website allgovernmentsliecom has screening dates  a list of lies  and a list of good journalists who expose lies  the lists on the website are not identical to the content of the film but theres a good deal of overlap  enough to give you a sense of what this project is about 
id have made various changes and additions to the film in particular im tired of all the focus on iraq  this film touches on war lies since then but still gives that one particular set of war lies prominence 
still this is a film that should be shown in cities homes and classrooms across the united states it includes and is driven by noam chomskys analysis of how the media system is rigged without those doing the rigging believing theyve done anything at all its a survey of skullduggery by corporate media its an introduction to numerous journalists far superior to the norm and its an introduction to if stone it includes footage of a presentation of the annual izzy award which goes to journalists acting in stones tradition 
one of the lies listed in the film and on the website is that of the gulf of tonkin nonincident anyone paying attention knows of it now as a war lie and it was a transparent war lie at the time in a particular sense that is had the north vietnamese really shot back at a us ship off their coast that would not have been any sort of legal much less moral justification for escalating a war id love it if people could grasp that logic and apply it to the black sea the red sea and every other part of the earth today 
but the gulf of tonkin lies about vietnamese aggression against the us ships innocently patrolling and firing off the coast of vietnam were not transparent to people with faith in the us role of global policeman someone had to make the lies transparent someone had to document that in fact the secretary of socalled defense and the president were lying sadly nobody did that in the first  hours after the congressional committee hearings and that was all it took for congress to hand the president a war 
and it was decades before white house transcripts came out and before the national security agency confessed and additional years before former secretary robert mcnamara did yet those revelations simply confirmed what people paying attention knew and they knew it because of if stone who just weeks after the nonincident published a fourpage edition of his weekly newsletter exclusively about tonkin 
stones analysis is useful in looking at the incident or lack thereof this past month in the red sea off yemen and in fact it is to yemen that stone immediately turned on page  in  the united nations including its us ambassador had recently condemned british attacks on yemen that britain defended as retaliatory president dwight eisenhower had also warned the french against retaliatory attacks on tunisia and president lyndon johnson even at the time of tonkin stone notes was warning greece and turkey not to engage in retaliatory attacks on each other 
stone who tended to look even at written laws that nobody else paid any heed to pointed out that three of them banned these sorts of attacks the league of nations covenant the kelloggbriand pact and the un charter the latter two are still theoretically in place for the us government 
the united states in vietnam stone goes on to show could not have been innocently attacked but itself admitted to having already sunk a number of vietnamese boats and indeed the us ships stone reports were in north vietnamese waters and were there to assist south vietnamese ships that were shelling two north vietnamese islands and in fact those ships had been supplied to south vietnam by the us military and the good old american tax payers 
stone did not have access to closed committee hearings but he hardly needed it he considered the assertions made in speeches by the only two senators who voted against the war and then he looked for any rejoinders by the chairmen of the committees he found their denials to be nondenials and nonsensical it made no sense that the us ships simply happened to be randomly hanging around in the vicinity of the south vietnamese ships stone didnt believe it 
stone also filled in the background information the united states had been supporting guerrilla attacks on north vietnam for years prior to the nonincident and stone raised numerous suspicions including the question of why the us ships had supposedly made sure they were out in international waters for the nonincident to not occur and the question of why in the world vietnam would take on the united states military something nobody could explain though eugene mccarthy proposed that perhaps they had been bored 
missing from the film and website of all governments lie is if stones work on lies about the outbreak of the korean war weve learned more since he wrote it but seen little more insightful relevant or timely for our understanding of korea and the world today this entry was posted in general  bookmark the permalink",Fake

why would i want to listen to advice from someone like steven schmidt who advised a presidential candidate mccain who was not able to make it how can he say trumps priorites are off he has out performed his opponent in the past month in regards to his campaigning for the wh hands down the only reason so many people are quick to judge trump and call him a failure is because so many criminals  career politicians and their partners in crime have so much to loose i would imagine that some are even considering leaving the country to avoid prosecution once trump is elected as potus afterthought this pitstop in dc for the opening dedication of this new hotel can actually be seen as part of his campaigning as it shows people that he is able to accomplish what others have failed to do under budget and ahead of schedule you never hear about hillary taking tons of time off the campaign trail or her lack of press conferences and interviews with the media or her lack of on the road campaign rallies trump takes a brief stop in dc and schmidt claims the walls are falling in on trunp really,Fake
he has been campaigning nonstop where as hillary has hardly been out at all i think he will be just fine attending the grand opening trump trump trump,Fake
"republican presidential nominee donald trump has reached a financial accomplishment that no other gop candidate has before
he has amassed the largest smalldonor fundraising pack that has ever been seen in the republican party
zac moffatt an online fundraising expert said that only those most committed to the candidate will typically donate
 
related stories newt gingrich defends donald trump against sexual predator accusations donald trumps star on hollywood walk of fame vandalized independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio the people who donate are your core believers said moffatt who was digital director for mitt romneys  campaign
romney and sen john mccain the  gop nominee each raised more overall in their respective campaigns than trump has in total contributions
however trumps campaign has topped both of the former nominees in small individual contributions defined as  or less
 
in this category trump has raised more than  million thus far based on data from the federal election commission
in comparison mccain raised  million and romney raised  million by this point in their election races
while mccain and romney had significant income contributions from other sources trumps smalldonor income makes up  percent of his overall funds
according to opensecretsorg small donations are a key category because for those below  mark the campaigns arent legally required to register personal information on the donor whereas if the donation exceeds  the campaign must give the donors name occupation employer and zip code
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias you could make an argument that he is the best candidate to refresh the rncs online fundraising database because of the different kind of donor that hes gotten said vincent harris a gop digital strategist who did private digital work for trumps campaign
as of oct  the trump campaign ceased all events meant to raise money for the partys getoutthevote effort electing instead to have trump focus on getting across his final message to voters
weve kind of wound down said steven mnuchin trumps national finance chairman but the online fundraising continues to be strong
we have minimized his fundraising schedule over the last month to emphasize his focus on political events mnuchin continued unlike democratic nominee hillary clinton who has been fundraising and not out and about he has constantly been out and about
this decision has been questioned by some given that clintons campaign has raised  million according to opensecrets which is  million more than the  million trump has raised
clinton has  events lined up before nov 
what do you think",Fake
i think clinton has bought her way with large donors into this oresidency it reeks of big money pay for play quid pro quo you scratch my back ill scratch yours and its the antithesis of what democratic voters think they are getting in hillary clinton a sad testimony to an election of the people for the people by the people her campaigh is all about big money power and greed,Fake
id love to see clinton spend all her money and losepenniless,Fake
this proves that even though the power elites are not behind trump but rather they are behind the evil daughter of satan the people are behind donald trump,Fake
dont worry the people are coming to take back their country,Fake
theres no question mr trumps campaign has energized many new voters but the problem is    the braindeadrnc probably are still too arrogant and ignorant to capitalize on the greatest opportunity since president reagan,Fake
she can have an event daily it will never change trump voters,Fake

in the exchange which lasted several minutes gingrich said i am sick and tired of people like you using language that is inflammatory thats not true
 
kelly reminded the speaker that while she was not taking a position on the allegations he did not know whether they were true or not
according to gingrich she took a position when she uttered the words
gingrich accused kelly of being fascinated with sex and unconcerned about the issues and public policy
me really kelly said before adding well you know what speaker im not fascinated by sex but i am fascinated by the protection of women and understanding what were getting in the oval office and i think the american voters would like to know

"theres a reason david brock founder of the liberal group media matters for america chooses to house an unregistered professional solicitor in his office to raise money for his conglomerate of super pacs and nonprofits
professional solicitors are required to disclose their active solicitation contracts brock wants his unregistered solicitor the bonner group to keep its client list hidden for a very specific reason
david brock is laundering money 
 
related stories consumers need protection from new consumer protection bureau rule heres what the markets are telling us exposed profiteers of governing  and these are the ones who got caught brock has seven nonprofits three super pacs one  committee one llc one joint fundraising committee and one unregistered solicitor crammed into his office in washington 
uncovered records expose a constant flow of money between these organizations
the bonner group his professional solicitor works off a commission every time money gets passed around bonner receives a  percent cut
 
follow the money 
nonprofits are required to disclose to whom they give cash grants
but they arent required to disclose who gives them cash grants
this weak system of oneway verification is being abused by brock hes been cycling money between his organizations for years and the bonner groups  percent commission gets triggered after every pass
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency in  media matters for america raised more than  million
the bonner group was credited for raising these funds media matters paid it a  million commission

that same year media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum  an organization that shares office space with media matters

in  the franklin education forum reported  in total contributions and  percent of that total came from media matters
surprisingly though the franklin education forum gave full credit to bonner for raising that money it paid the fundraiser a  commission in 

notice what happened 
brocks media matters gave a  cash grant to brocks franklin education forum brocks franklin education forum credited the bonner group for raising those funds triggering the  percent commission brock paid the bonner group a  commission to solicit a cash grant  from himself it doesnt stop there 
after the franklin education forum retained  it sent a  cash grant to brocks franklin forum  

note the franklin education forum is a c and the franklin forum is a c they are not the same company 
the franklin forum c paid bonner a commission in   so its safe to assume the fundraiser received a  commission in  unfortunately its hard to tell for sure it still hasnt filed its taxes for 
lets recap 
say for example you donate  to media matters for america this is how david brock would have used your charitable donation in 
media matters would receive your  donation the bonner group would earn a  commission media matters would retain  next media matters would give whats left of your entire donation   to the franklin education forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin education forum would retain  the franklin education forum would then forward the remaining  to the franklin forum the bonner group would earn a  commission the franklin forum would retain  in the end brocks solicitor would have pocketed  almost a third of your initial donation thats a far cry from the advertised  percent commission
as bizarre as that scenario may sound this is exactly what brock did in 
how can we be sure this is intentional 
brock is the chairman for each of these organizations how could he not know whats going on
hes a handson chairman according to their tax returns brock allocates time weekly to his organizations
media matters  hours per week franklin education forum three hours per week the franklin forum one hour per week furthermore the new york times reports that brock shares a summer rental in the hamptons with mary pat bonner the president of the bonner group
brock would have a hard time claiming ignorance on this these transfers are intentional he vacations with his solicitor case closed
still not convinced 
brock didnt even bother to give his organizations different phone numbers they all share the same number

what if  
we even located the bonner groups solicitation agreement with media matters on floridas gift givers guide  clarification on the commission can be found on page 

in english contractually brock has the option to exclude certain contributions from triggering the commission in spite of this option he intentionally chooses to trigger the  percent commission for money grants between his organizations
note yes we are making the assumption that all of brocks organizations have the same solicitation agreement with the bonner group given that his organizations share the same address board members and telephone number we feel its safe to assume they also share the same solicitation agreement 
this barely scratches the surface 
utilizing publicfacing tax returns along with records submitted to the federal election commission we mapped out all the significant money transfers from  that took place in brocks office

summary 
this is all from just one year no further commentary required
we understand this may be hard to believe we first came across this in july and are still having a hard time wrapping our heads around it
all of the data referenced in this article originated from publicly accessible sources check for yourself  we provided links to the source material in our article exposing the organizations operating in brocks office these data have been sitting out in the open gathering dust for years 
if it looks like a duck swims like a duck and quacks like a duck then it probably is a duck
weve spent months trying to find some sort of loophole to justify this activity but there arent any loopholes david brock has something to hide just last month the daily caller reported the following
brocks former longtime livein boyfriend william grey whom brock has thanked in several of his books threatened to go to the irs with damaging information about how brock was running his media matters empire what did brock do he paid grey  to keep quiet brock reportedly had to sell his home in rehoboth delaware to come up with the money this certainly seems to indicate that brock was terrified about what the authorities would uncover
adding to this fox news reported the following
grey accused brock of financial malfeasance and threatened to undermine brocks fundraising efforts
next step is i contact all your donors and the irs grey wrote in an email dated may   this is going to stink for you if you do not resolve this now
we believe that the information presented in this article is what has brock so terrified we feel confident in saying with close to absolute certainty that david brock is laundering money through his media matters conglomerate

"after the release of a wikileaks email chain from march  on tuesday in which a top clinton aide admitted president barack obama falsely claimed he did not know about hillary clintons private server use while she was secretary of state white house press secretary josh earnest sprung into action to deny that the president had lied about the issue
what the president said was an entirely factual response earnest said to a group of reporters in los angeles where obama was attending democratic fundraisers
earnest then attempted to explain away all criticism of the presidents actions as mere conspiracies
 
related stories hannity proposes a sendoff for obama in the event of a trump presidency wikileaks podesta said obamas dont need to be this nice to president bush and first lady wikileaks reveals obama knew about clintons emails clean this up i recognize that some of the presidents critics have attempted to construct some type of conspiracy about the communication between the president and the secretary of state he said
he continued but theyve failed to put forward a conspiracy that withstands any scrutiny so i guess they are back to recycling thoroughly debunked conspiracies
obama himself denied any knowledge of the server telling cbs reporter bill plante in march  just after the server revelations that he learned of the clintons private email server the same time everybody else learned it through news reports
 
several days after the server revelations in march  earnest told the press that obama knew about clintons email address and had sent messages to it but knew nothing about a private server
he reiterated that position on tuesday
the president did trade emails with secretary clinton not a large number of them earnest said
of course the president had possession of secretary clintons email address but he did not have any knowledge of where her server was located or what sort of arrangements had been made to store her email
 
trending stories frustrated with media bias trump campaign takes its case directly to voters with nightly show on facebook independent voters push trump to the front in florida and ohio rnc official takes cnn host to task for claiming there is no media bias however the wikileaks email chain  which earnest referred to as stolen and therefore illegitimate  tells a different story with top clinton aides seemingly in a panic that it could come to light that the president was lying when he said he did not know about clintons private server
looks like potus just said he found out hrc was using her personal email when he saw it in the news clinton spokesman josh schwerin said in a march   email published tuesday by wikileaks
we need to clean this up  he has emails from her  they do not say stategov responded former clinton chief of staff cheryl mills

i dont think any different than i did before he was elected he was a fraud before he was elected and hes still a fraud one day when we once again live in a country where justice is blind and the rule of law prevails he as well as hrc will be prosecuted and thrown in prison,Fake
when you say the server obama didnt know exactly which serial number was associated with this piece of hardware so you can say it was factual that obama himself denied any knowledge of the server he did not have knowledge of the color of the ribbon cable between the hard drive he did not know how much memory was associated with it all he knew was something about the tax payers didnt have to cover the cost of the machine for this he was glad,Fake

stolen but factual just shows how crooked they are,Fake
surely you josh,Fake
obama lies all of the time he doesnt bother to even check the facts to make sure that the is telling the truth this is just another instance of this we need to ask other questions was he sending unsecured emails to hrc he would need a different smime certificate to send an encrypted email to hrc than the one for addresses because hrc wouldnt have the private key for the state department certificate so we have to presume that he knew that he was sending unsecured emial to hrc the location of the server is a red herring it was somewhere in cyberspace what matters is that it was that she was using a private email account that appeared to be unsecured the fact that it was unsecured is the major point here if it had been properly secured with digital cryptography it wouldnt have really mattered if it was in her home at least as far as national securty was concerned,Fake
he is not going to admit he knew this needs to be investigated they lie so much neither one of them can keep this stuff straight,Fake
yep just found out he screened positions in his administration for muslims specifically you are correct muslim this is a violation of church and state the same phrase he uses bitterly hanging on to their religion and jihad and the quran it would be good to find out where these people live and we could go and do candle vigils outside their homes mills podesta and the usual suspects trump is spot on and of course we did not know this from the beginning marxism and islam are strangely compatable both believe that is entirely permissable to lie to advance its agenda theere is no word to describe the loathing i feel for this bunch of worm bait hate is such a clam word jesus said to write a letter to several churches in his direction as to what to write he said i know you hate those who hate me nevertheless i have some things against you hate was not a negative term when used in the proper context,Fake

back in  when bill clinton was running for reelection he authorized the transfer of highly sensitive technology to china this technology had military applications and allowed china to close the gap in missile performance with the united states the transfers were opposed and severely criticized by the defense department 
at the same time bill clinton was transferring this technology to china huge donations began to pour into his reelection campaign from the us companies allowed to sell the technology to china and from american citizens of chinese descent the fact that they were us citizens allowed them to donate to political campaigns but it later emerged that they were acting as conduits for cash coming in from asian sources including chinese intelligence agencies the scandal eventually became known as chinagate 
john huang 
a close associate of indonesian industrialist james riady huang initially was appointed deputy secretary of commerce in  by  however he moved to the democratic national committee where he generated hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources huang later pleaded guilty to one felony count of campaign finance violations 
charlie trie 
like john huang trie raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal contributions from foreign sources to democratic campaign entities he was a regular white house visitor and arranged meetings of foreign operators with clinton including one who was a chinese arms dealer his  contribution to clintons legal defense fund was returned after it was found to have been largely funded by asian interests trie was convicted of violating campaign finance laws in  
one of tries main sources of cash was chinese billionaire ng lap seng according to a senate report ng lap seng had connections to the chinese government seng was arrested in  over an unrelated bribery case but this gave investigators the opportunity to question seng about the chinagate scandal former united nations general assembly president john ashe was also caught in the bribery case and was about to testify to the links between the clintons and seng when he was found dead that very morning initially reported as having died from a heart attack johns throat had obviously been crushed at that point the official story changed to him accidentally dropping a barbell on his own throat 
ng lap seng with the clintons 
johnny chung 
gave more than  to the democratic national committee prior to the  campaign but it was returned after officials learned it came from illegal foreign sources chung later told a special senate committee investigating  clinton campaign fundraising that  of his contributions came from individuals in chinese intelligence chung pleaded guilty to bank fraud tax evasion and campaign finance violations 
chinagate documented by judicial watch was uncovered by judicial watch founder larry klayman technology companies allegedly made donations of millions of dollars to various democratic party entities including president bill clintons  reelection campaign in return for permission to sell hightech secrets to china bernard schwartz and his loral space  communication ltd later allegedly helped china to identify the cause of a rocket failure thereby advancing chinas missile program and threatening us national security according to records 
this establishes a history of the clintons treating us secrets as their own personal property and selling them to raise money for campaigns 
is history repeating itself it appears so 
let us consider a private email server with weak security at least one known totally open access point no encryption at all and outside the control and monitoring systems of the us government on which are parked many of the nations most closely guarded secrets as well as those of the united nations and other foreign governments it is already established that hillarys email was hacked one hacker named guccifer provided copies of emails to russia today which published them",Fake

"click for full size picturek my theory 
my theory of the downing of the aircraft is derived from the two reported wreckage sites the lie about the weather given out by the government and the loss of three radio links at the same time while the plane was still  miles from the crash site signs the plane was sabotaged 
first off the claims made in both time and newsweek that ron browns plane crashed in the worst storm in a decade are directly contradicted by the weather report issued by the dubrovnik airport tower adjacent to the crash site the storm simply did not exist 
while the plane carrying ron brown and his party was still  miles from the crash site  mile in the air and on the normal approach path three radio based links with three separate propagation paths all failed at the same time 
according to the aviation week  space technology article the dubrovnik tower lost voice radio contact at the same time the aircraft vanished from the screens of the approach radar at split and an awacs 
lets look at the split radar first 
the split radar watches the approach to dubrovnik airport which is where the ron brown aircraft was when it dropped off of the radar screen contrary to some silly claims made in this newsgroup before the plane was not flying in the mountains it was out over the water with open space all around the radar at split routinely tracks aircraft through that airspace without problem if it were normal for the split radar to lose traffic at that point on the approach path nobody would have mentioned it because it would be normal and expected behavior nothing unusual about it that comment was made about the target dropping off of the split radar establishes that it was an unusual event 
the split radar like all atc radar tracks primarily by aircraft transponder so when the split radar lost track of the ron brown aircraft what was lost was the transponder return as the aircraft was still on the approach path although just starting to veer slightly left 
now lets look at the awacs 
the awacs system is designed to track nontranspondered targets radar hits are placed in a computer system that keeps a list and tries to match the returns from the present radar sweep to the returns from the previous sweeps in order to generate meaningful target tracking data for the operators and weapons management systems part of that process involves target to target comparisons to make certain that what the computer thinks is target xyz this sweep is the same target it thought was xyz last sweep the total workload on the computer is a power function of the total number of nontranspondered targets being carried in the target list 
if a target has a transponder the awacs will track the target using the transponder return because not only is less computer power needed for a transpondered target but the workload for nontranspondered targets is reduced 
how do we know that the awacs was tracking the ron brown plane via transponder because the awacs lost its track at the same time that the split radar lost its transponder return had the awacs been tracking the ron brown plane via skinpaint there is no reason for it to lose track of the aircraft at the same time that split did 
had the awacs not reported losing contact we could surmise that either the awacs was tracking on skin paint or the split radar suffered a momentary failure but this was not the case 
it is also true that the awacs could have immediately reacquired the ron brown aircraft on skin paint and its not known for a fact that the computers did not add it as a nontranspondered target but the awacs was there to watch bosnia not the dubrovnik airport 
the two radar tracks propagating along two different paths come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and that is the radar transponder in the ron brown aircraft a failure of the transponder is the only explanation for the ron brown plane vanishing from two different radar screens at the same time while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea 
at the same time that the aircraft vanished from the radars at split and the awacs the dubrovnik tower reported it lost voice radio contact with the aircraft 
this is a third distinct propagation path from the awacs and split in fact its direct line of sight from the dubrovnik tower to the location on the approach path where radio contact was lost there are no intervening geological features to block the radio signal the dubrovnik tower continued to communicate with other aircraft in the area so the radios in the tower were not at fault 
the data reported in the aviation week  space technology article shows evidence that two sperate systems on board the ron brown aircraft failed at the same time the cockpit radios and the radar transponder 
the radios and radar transponders come together at only one common point where a single failure could make the aircraft vanish from both split and the awacs and lose voice radio contact with the dubrovnik tower and that is is the electrical system failed in mid air while still  miles from the crash site and  mile above the adriatic sea on the approach path how do we know the problem extended beyond the electrical system 
simple prior to the loss of radio the flight crew had acknowledged receiving a weather report they knew there was clear air beneath them there is only one reason for the flight crew suddenly without any instruments at all not to descend out of a cloud layer into the clear air they knew was below them and thats if the event that severed the electrical cables also severed the flight control cables which occupy the same midline conduit in the  possible trigger 
given the unscheduled nature of the trip a timer would be useless to pinpoint the exact geographic location of the detonation however knowing the approach pattern into the airport a location over the adriatic can be selected by the altitude of the aircraft along the glide slope 
the simplest explanation which fits the twin wreckage sites and the early news reports of a water crash is that of an altitude triggered bomb placed on the aircraft prior to departure as the aircraft climbs above a certain altitude the device is armed as the aircraft descends through the trigger altitude say  feet the device detonates why did the plane make it to shore 
as the reports have pointed out the weather was not ideal the pilot even with the best navigation aids in the world would be fully justified in delaying his descent in order to stay in clear air as long as possible then ducking quickly down through the clouds to find the airfield 
this means that the altitude triggered bomb would have detonated far closer to land than expected with the result that portions of the wreckage came on shore 
the  mile spread between wreckage sites indicates an airborne event which blew part of the aircraft off the same  mile distance coupled with the shallow impact angle suggests that the aircraft was still flyable and that the pilot may have been trying to make it to the airfield when the crash into the hill occurred was thermite used 
its impossible to state based on the information available to the public but thermite is a definite possibility it can be made using available materials and will not show up on the various detectors which would sense chemical explosives such as c thermite when ignited burns at half the temperature of the surface of the sun and would burn through the aluminum of an aircraft with ease packed in a suitcase near the top of the baggage compartment of the converted  it would be in an ideal location to sever the control linkages and to short out the planes electrical system as well as burning a hole through the skin dumping debris into the ocean how bad was the weather 
there were several reports in the media that dubrovnik was in the grip of the worst storm of the decade this is not true as can be seen by the weather information contained in the aviation week article and the first news articles from reuters the weather was not exceptionally bad indeed the wind conditions were excellent providing a  knot head wind with no cross component at the runway perfect landing conditions below the overcast at  feet visibility was km or  miles assorted news articles washington april  upi  a us air force plane carrying commerce secretary ron brown in the

by shane wright  voter fraud is a contentious issue of late liberals swear it is a myth propagated by evil racist conservatives we know better most on the right are aware of the voter fraud issue but many have little to no idea how to combat or report violations consider this your crash course first and foremost step one in any instance where you see or suspect voter fraud is to alert the state officials who oversee the election process for most states this is done by the secretary of state in other states there is a state board of elections notifying these officials is paramount as they are the ones who ultimately certify and authenticate elections alert them before you call fox news or blow up twitter though drawing as much media attention as possible is beneficial you want to make sure you follow a process i have included a contact list for each state at the bottom of this post in many cases once you have alerted the state authorities they will direct you to the proper city or county officials where you will fill out paperwork bureaucracy at its finest go ahead and jump through their hoops if you witnessed the fraud chances are someone else did too make a good effort to get other witness names and contact information as well this will strengthen your case and increase the likelihood that state and county officials will step in and act on your complaint if as has happened before state officials ignore you entirely your next step is to contact your state attorney general and alert them of the situation however before you do this you need to arm yourself with knowledge of your specific states election laws you will be more credible if you are able to cite the specific statutes which were violated state laws are generally published online however it may actually be quicker and easier for you to go to your local library or courthouse and utilize their search engines in my experience relevant case law and updated statutes can be difficult to sort through on google or other internet search sites the attorney general should conduct an investigation to determine whether or not there is enough evidence andor information to take legal action if state officials refuse to work with you your next step is to alert both your state representative and state senator they may intercede and it is in the secretary of state and attorney generals best interest to respond professionally and quickly to these representatives should you continue to hit dead ends on the state level its time to alert the department of justice before doing this call your congressman and senator in some cases they will be willing to write a letter on your behalf to the doj this is what your goal is ultimately for the doj is less likely to ignore these officials if going through your elected officials is a poor option as it may very well be depending on the circumstances review federal election law and proceed anyways finally you and i both know that the doj nor liberal state officials are likely to do anything about a claim of election fraud however it is absolutely imperative that you go through these motions and document these steps to preserve any future legal options documenting instances of election fraud will continue to strengthen our case for voter id furthermore it is important to press forward on these criminals so that its understood that we will not idly stand by and allow our elections to be manipulated last but not least use your head if you see or suspect voter manipulation have the courage to record it whip out your phone and start shooting video  and report it to the appropriate authorities first alabama,Fake

how to have honest elections it is enough that the people know there was an election the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything  joseph stalin 
following the florida election debacle of  americans were promised a more honest transparent and verifiable system of elections we didnt get it because the elkection stealers won that election and decided that keeping the current system was their best guaarantee of reelection 
the election of  changed that the candidate being cheated by the system donald trump still prevailed thanks to a landslide that overcame the vote rigging he will see having an honest election system as his best chance for a second term hence there is a real opportunity to throw out the current system whch is designed to encourage stealing elections and replace it with a system that hinders cheating as much as possible 
to begin stolen elections are a reality in this nation john f kennedy stole the  election from richard nixon nixon stole his reelection in what becvame known as the watergate scandal george w bush likely stole the  election from al gore and everyone had a ringside seat watching hillary clinton trying to steal the election from donald trump 
a good place to start to learn about election stealing is the hbo documentary hacking democracy it is available on netflix amazon live and hulu here is a youtube video of the final scenes showing how an electronic voting machine has the election results changed without even needing to touch the machine 
for more information please visit httpblackboxvotingorg  the website operated by bev harris who is featured in the hbo documentary 
now then i wish to offer a suggestion for a very simple way to have an open and honest election system it is not  foolproof but is designed to make it very difficult for cheating to happen and difficult to conceal it this stands in sharp contrast to the current system which is designed to facilitate and conceal the manipulation of elections 
first some basic rules 
 no electronic machines 
 no central tabulation centers 
everyone who votes must have id to prove they are a us citizen and eligable to vote absentee ballots are only given to those who can prove they are unable to vote in person 
after the voters vote their finger is marked with ink that takes a week to fade away to prevent them from voting more than once 
all voting is done on paper ballots when the polls close the precincts handcount the ballots in full view of witnesses and verify the accuracy all paper ballots are to be stored for an entire year after the election 
the totals for that polling place are posted for all to see and copies provided to all witnesses 
in the city newspaper the next day all the totals for all the city precincts are printed along with totals for the state this allows everyone to first verify that their precinct totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the city totals for themselves 
now we move up a level the state newspapers print all the city totals and again the totals for the state this allows everyone to first verify that their city totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the state totals for themselves 
final level the national newspapers print all the state totals and tally up the winners this allows everyone to first verify that their state totals were reported accurately and to verify the math leading to the national totals for themselves 
what this does is create a system where there are literally millions of americans watching and verifying the vote counts from polling place to final totals yes it is a bit slower than the instantguessing on tv but that will prevent the corporate media from using projections to try to discourage voters of unfavored candidates from heading to the polls there is in fact no law that says the winners of the elections have to be announced immediately and certainly most americans are willing to trade speed for accuracy in such an important matter in the early days of this nation prior to the telegraph it would take weeks for the populace to learn who won the elections 
as i said this is not a  perfect system it is only as good as the people running it but it does make stealing elections very difficult and that should always be the design objective of any election system share this article with your social media",Fake
"louis t mcfadden 
louis t mcfadden 
louis t mcfadden was a member of the house of representatives in the twenties and thirties he was the chair of the house banking and currency committee during the twenties he used his position in congress occasionally to crusade against the federal reserve mr chairman we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks the federal reserve board a government board has cheated the government of the united states out of enough money to pay the national debt the depredations and the iniquities of the federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks acting together have cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over this evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the united states has bankrupted itself and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through defects of the law under which it operates through the maladministration of that law by the federal reserve board and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it  louis t mcfadden june   
at one point mcfadden started impeachment proceedings against the entire board of the federal reserve not too surprisingly there were three attempts on mcfaddens life one shooting and two poisonings the second of which was cuccessful although still officially declared as heart failure newspapers of the time reported  now that this sterling american patriot has made the passing it can be revealed that not long after his public utterance against the encroaching powers of judah it became known among his intimates that he had suffered two attacks against his life the first attack came in the form of two revolver shots fired at him from ambush as he was alighting from a cab in front of one of the capital hotels fortunately both shots missed him the bullets burying themselves in the structure of the cab 
he became violently ill after partaking of food at a political banquet at washington his life was only saved from what was subsequently announced as a poisoning by the presence of a physician friend at the banquet who at once procured a stomach pump and subjected the congressman to emergency treatment 
president john f kennedy 
president john f kennedy 
as president john f kennedy understood the predatory nature of private central banking he understood why andrew jackson fought so hard to end the second bank of the united states so kennedy wrote and signed executive order  which ordered the us treasury to issue a new public currency the united states note 
kennedys united states note  click for larger 
kennedys united states notes were not borrowed from the federal reserve but created by the us government and backed by the silver stockpiles held by the us government it represented a return to the system of economics the united states had been founded on and was perfectly legal for kennedy to do all told some four and one half billion dollars went into public circulation eroding interest payments to the federal reserve and loosening their control over the nation five months later john f kennedy was assassinated in dallas texas and the united states notes pulled from circulation and destroyed except for samples held by collectors 
john j mccloy 

john j mccloy president of the chase manhattan bank and president of the world bank was named to the warren commission presumably to make certain the banking dimensions behind the assassination were concealed from the public kennedys eo  has never been repealed and is still in effect although no modern president dares to use it almost all of the current national debt has been created since  
as we enter the eleventh year of what future history will most certainly describe as world war three we need to examine the financial dimensions behind the wars 
towards the end of world war two when it became obvious that the allies were going to win and dictate the post war environment the major world economic powers met at bretton woods a luxury resort in new hampshire in july of  and hammered out the bretton woods agreement for international finance the british pound lost its position as the global trade and reserve currency to the us dollar part of the price demanded by roosevelt in exchange for the us entry into the war absent the economic advantages of being the worlds goto currency britain was forced to nationalize the bank of england in  the bretton woods agreement ratified in  in addition to making the dollar the global reserve and trade currency obligated the signatory nations to tie their currencies to the dollar the nations that ratified bretton woods did so on two conditions the first was that the federal reserve would refrain from overprinting the dollar as a means to loot real products and produce from other nations in exchange for ink and paper basically an imperial tax that assurance was backed up by the second requirement which was that the us dollar would always be convertible to gold at  per ounce 
the bretton woods resort new hampshire 
the federal reserve being a private bank and not answerable to the us government did start overprinting paper dollars and much of the perceived prosperity of the s and s was the result of foreign nations obligations to accept the paper notes as being worth gold at the rate of  an ounce then in  france looked at the huge pile of paper notes sitting in their vaults for which real french products like wine and cheese had been traded and notified the united states government that they would exercise their option under bretton woods to return the paper notes for gold at the  per ounce exchange rate the united states had nowhere near the gold to redeem the paper notes by  the imf estimated foreign central banks held  billion us dollars however the united states had only  billion in gold to redeem those paper notes so on august th  richard nixon temporarily suspended the gold convertibility of the us federal reserve notes 
nixon announces the end of gold convertability 
later termed the nixon shock this move effectively ended bretton woods and many global currencies started to delink from the us dollar 
the nixon shock 
worse since the united states had collateralized their loans with the nations gold reserves it quickly became apparent that the us government did not in fact have enough gold to cover the outstanding debts foreign nations began to get very nervous about their loans to the us and understandably were reluctant to loan any additional money to the united states without some form of collateral so richard nixon started the environmental movement with the epa and its various programs such as wilderness zones roadless areas heritage rivers wetlands all of which took vast areas of public lands and made them off limits to the american people who were technically the owners of those lands but nixon had little concern for the environment and the real purpose of this land grab under the guise of the environment was to pledge those pristine lands and their vast mineral resources as collateral on the national debt the plethora of different programs was simply to conceal the true scale of how much american land was being pledged to foreign lenders as collateral on the governments debts eventually almost  of the nation itself all of this is illegal as the enclave clause of the constitution limits the federal government to owning the land under federal government buildings and military bases and that enclave clause was written into the constitution by the founding fathers specifically to prevent the federal government simply seizing the land belonging to the people to sell off pledge as collateral or rent

with open lands for collateral already in short supply the us government embarked on a new program to shore up sagging international demand for the dollar the united states approached the worlds oil producing nations mostly in the middle east and offered them a deal in exchange for only selling their oil for dollars the united states would guarantee the military safety of those oilrich nations the oil rich nations would agree to spend and invest their us paper dollars inside the united states in particular in us treasury bonds redeemable through the slave labor of future generations of us taxpayers the concept was labeled the petrodollar in effect the us no longer able to back the dollar with gold was now backing it with oil other peoples oil and that necessity to keep control over those oil nations to prop up the dollar has shaped americas foreign policy in the region ever since 
but as americas manufacturing and agriculture has declined the oil producing nations faced a dilemma those piles of us federal reserve notes were not able to purchase much from the united states because the united states had little other than real estate anyone wanted to buy europes cars and aircraft were superior and less costly while experiments with gmo food crops led to nations refusing to buy us food exports israels constant belligerence against its neighbors caused them to wonder if the us could actually keep their end of the petrodollar arrangement oil producing nations started to talk of selling their oil for whatever currency the purchasers chose to use 
saddam hussein and the lie of iraqs nuclear weapons 
saddam hussein 
iraq already hostile to the united states following desert storm demanded the right to sell their oil for euros in  and in  the united nations agreed to allow it under the oil for food program instituted following desert storm one year later the united states reinvaded iraq under the lie of saddams nuclear weapons lynched saddam hussein and placed iraqs oil back on the world market only for us dollars 
the clear us policy shift following  away from being an impartial broker of peace in the mideast to one of unquestioned support for israels aggressions only further eroded confidence in the petrodollar deal and even more oil producing nations started openly talking of oil trade for other global currencies 
gaddafi and the gold dinar 
gaddafi 
over in libya muammar gaddafi had instituted a stateowned central bank and a value based trade currency the gold dinar 
the gold dinar 
gaddafi announced that libyas oil was for sale but only for the gold dinar other african nations seeing the rise of the gold dinar and the euro even as the us dollar continued its inflationdriven decline flocked to the new libyan currency for trade this move had the potential to seriously undermine the global hegemony of the dollar french president nicolas sarkozy reportedly went so far as to call libya a threat to the financial security of the world so the united states invaded libya brutally murdered qaddafi  the object lesson of saddams lynching not being enough of a message apparently imposed a private central bank and returned libyas oil output to dollars only the gold that was to have been made into the gold dinars  tons of it is as of last report unaccounted for 
update emails surfacing as part of the investigation into hilary clintons use of a private email server for classified information confirm that the real reason for the us invasion of libya was to destroy the threat of the gold dinar becoming a panafrican currency displacing the dollar 
general wesley clark blows the whistle on us plans to conquer the oilrich middle east 
according to general wesley clark the master plan for the dollarification of the worlds oil nations included seven targets iraq syria lebanon libya somalia sudan and iran venezuela which dared to sell their oil to china for the yuan is a late addition what is notable about the original seven nations originally targeted by the us is that none of them are members of the bank for international settlements the private central bankers private central bank located in switzerland this meant that these nations were deciding for themselves how to run their nations economies rather than submit to the international private banks 
update emails from secretary of state hillary clinton released as part of the benghazi investigation confirm that the true motive for the attack on libya was to control the libyan oil reserves and to destroy libyas goldbacked currency 
now the bankers gun sights are on iran which dares to have a government central bank and sell their oil for whatever currency they choose the war agenda is as always to force irans oil to be sold only for us dollars and to force them to accept a privately owned central bank malaysia one of the few remaining nations without a rothschild central bank is now being invaded by a force claimed to be al qaeda and has suffered numerous suspicious losses of its commercial passenger jets 
with the death of president hugo chavez plans to impose a us and banker friendly regime on venezuela are clearly being implemented 
so just where is the gold 
germanys gold bullion where is it 
the german government recently asked for the return of some of their gold bullion from the bank of france and the new york federal reserve france has said it will take  years to return germanys gold the united states has said they will need  years to return germanys gold this suggests strongly that the bank of france and the ny federal reserve have used the deposited gold for other purposes most likely to cover gold futures contracts used to artificially suppress the price of gold to keep investors in the equities markets and the central banks are scrambling to find new gold to cover the shortfall and prevent a gold run so it is inevitable that suddenly france invades mali ostensibly to combat al qaeda with the us joining in mali just happens to be one of the worlds largest gold producers with gold accounting for  of mali exports war for the bankers does not get more obvious than that 
mexico has demanded a physical audit of their gold bullion stored at the bank of england and along with venezuelas vast oil reserves larger than saudi arabia venezuelas gold mines are a prize lusted after by all the central banks that played fast and loose with other peoples gold bullion so we can expect regime change if not outright invasion soon 
can a bank foreclose on your house if they have provided nothing of real value in the mortgage 
a little remembered footnote in banking history occurred in december  a bank was moving to foreclose on a house and the homeowner decided to fight the foreclosure in court arguing that contract law requires two contracting parties to agree to swap two items of value legally called the consideration in the case of first national bank of montgomery vs jerome daly  daly argued that since the bank simply wrote a number in a ledger to create the loaned money out of think air there was no real value and therefore no legally binding consideration the lawyers for the bank admitted that this is how the bank works they create money out of thin air as a ledger or computer entry which you must repay with your labor and there was no law in  that specifically gave banks the legal right to do that daly argued that because there was no equal consideration the mortgage was null and void and the attempt to foreclose invalid the jury agreed so did judge mahoney who resisted demands to overrule the jury in favor of the bank and wrote a simple streightforward decision that stated that there was no question that the mortgage contract was void because the claim that the bank simply made up the money out of thin air was not disputed by the bank itself 
judge mahoney was murdered with poison less than six months later and the lawyer representing daly was debarred the decision in favor of daly was then nullified on procedural grounds and the entire matter forgotten 
you are brainwashed 
you have been raised by a public school system and media that constantly assures you that the reasons for all these wars and assassinations are many and varied the us claims to bring democracy to the conquered lands they havent the usual result of a us overthrow is the imposition of a dictatorship such as the  cia overthrow of irans democratically elected government of mohammad mosaddegh and the imposition of the shah or the  cia overthrow of chiles democratically elected government of president salvador allende  and the imposition of augusto pinochet  or to save a people from a cruel oppressor revenge for  or that tired wornout catch all excuse for invasion weapons of mass destruction assassinations are always passed off as crazed lone nuts to obscure the real agenda 
the real agenda is simple it is enslavement of the people by creation of a false sense of obligation that obligation is false because the private central banking system by design always creates more debt than money with which to pay that debt private central banking is not science it is a religion a set of arbitrary rules created to benefit the priesthood meaning the owners of the private central bank the fraud persists with often lethal results because the people are tricked into believing that this is the way life is supposed to be and no alternative exists or should be dreamt of the same was true of two earlier systems of enslavement rule by divine right and slavery both systems built to trick people into obedience and both now recognized by modern civilizatyion as illegitimate now we are entering a time in human history where we will recognize that rule by debt or rule by private central bankers issuing the public currency as a loan at interest is equally illegitimate it only works as long as people allow themselves to believe that this is the way life is supposed to be 
but understand this above all private central banks do not exist to serve the people the community or the nation private central banks exist to serve their owners to make them rich beyond the dreams of midas and all for the cost of ink paper and the right bribe to the right official 
behind all these wars all these assassinations the hundred million horrible deaths from all the wars lies a single policy of dictatorship the private central bankers allow rulers to rule only on the condition that the people of a nation be enslaved to the private central banks failing that said ruler will be killed and their nation invaded by those other nations enslaved to private central banks 
the socalled clash of civilizations we read about on the corporate media is really a war between banking systems with the private central bankers forcing themselves onto the rest of the world no matter how many millions must die for it indeed the constant hatemongering against muslims lies in a simple fact like the ancient christians prior to the knights templars private banking system  muslims forbid usury or the lending of money at interest and that is the reason our government and media insist they must be killed or converted they refuse to submit to currencies issued at interest they refuse to be debt slaves 
so off to war your children must go to spill their blood for the moneyjunkies gold we barely survived the last two world wars in the nuclearbioweapon age are the private central bankers willing to risk incinerating the whole planet just to feed their greed 
apparently so 
this brings us to the current situation in the ukraine russia and china 
the european union had been courting the government of the ukraine to merge with the eu and more to the point entangle their economy with the privateowned european central bank the government of the ukraine was considering the move but had made no commitments part of their concern lay with the conditions in other eu nations enslaved to the ecb notably cyprus greece spain and italy so they were properly cautious then russia stepped in with a better deal and the ukraine exercising the basic choice all consumers have to choose the best product at the best price dropped the eu and announced they were going to go with russias offer it was at that point that agents provocateurs flooded into the ukraine covertly funded by intelligence agency fronts like canvas and usaid stirring up trouble while the western media proclaimed this was a popular revolution snipers shot at people and this violence was blamed on thenpresident yanukovich however a leaked recording of a phone call between the eus catherine ashton and estonias foreign minister urmas paet confirmed the snipers were working for the overthrow plotters not the ukrainian government urmas paet has confirmed the authenticity of that phone call 
this is a classic pattern of covert overthrow we have seen many times before since the end of ww the us has covertly tried to overthrow the governments of  nations succeeding  times examples include the  overthrow of irans elected government of mohammed mossadegh and the imposition of the shah the  overthrow of chiles elected government of salvador allende and the imposition of the pinochet dictatorship and of course the current overthrow of ukraines elected government of yanukovich and the imposition of the current unelected government which is already gutting the ukraines wealth to hand to the western bankers 
brazil russia india china and south africa have formed a parallel financial system called brics scheduled to officially launch on january   as of this writing some  nations are ready to trade with brics in transactions that do not involve the us dollar despite us economic warfare against both russia and china the ruble and yuan are seen as more attractive for international trade and banking than the us dollar hence the us attempt to fan the ukraine crisis into war with russia and attempts to provoke north korea as a back door to war with china

flag waving and propaganda aside all modern wars are wars by and for the private bankers fought and bled for by third parties unaware of the true reason they are expected to gracefully be killed and crippled for the process is quite simple as soon as the private central bank issues its currency as a loan at interest the public is forced deeper and deeper into debt when the people are reluctant to borrow any more that is when the keynesian economists demand the government borrow more to keep the pyramid scheme working when both the people and government refuse to borrow any more that is when wars are started to plunge everyone even deeper into debt to pay for the war then after the war to borrow more to rebuild when the war is over the people have about the same as they did before the war except the graveyards are far larger and everyone is in debt to the private bankers for the next century this is why brown brothers harriman in new york was funding the rise of adolf hitler 
as long as private central banks are allowed to exist inevitably as the night follows day there will be poverty hopelessness and millions of deaths in endless world wars until the earth itself is sacrificed in flames to mammon 
the path to true peace on earth lies in the abolishment of all private central banking everywhere and a return to the stateissued valuebased currencies that allow nations and people to become prosperous banks do not have an obligation to promote the public good  alexander dielius ceo germany austrian eastern europe goldman sachs  i am just a banker doing gods work  lloyd blankfein ceo goldman sachs ",Fake

the death of john kennedy by michael rivero
there have been two official investigations one concluded oswald acted alone the other that there was a conspiracy after half a century many of the key documents which could tell the whole story remain classified john f kennedys brain is still missing from the national archives why if it is an open and shut case why the secrecy if oswald was just a crazed lone gunman 
the house select committee on assassinations concluded that john f kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy based on the recording of the gunshots fired in dealey plaza captured over a police radio a total of  impulses were caught on the tape but citing budgetary constraints the hsca only had  of them analyzed the analysis concluded that all  were gunshots two of them occurring within  a second of each other too close to be fired by one man comparisons of the echoes with test shots fired in dealey plaza confirmed that at least one of the recorded shots had indeed been fired from the grassy knoll needless to say the existence of  rather than just  gunshots destroyed the oswald as lone gunman coverup warren supporters quickly tried to dismiss the audio record of the gunshots by claiming that the recording was actually of gunshots in another part of the city and confused for dealey plaza shots because of a timing error without explaining just where the other shots had occurred or why the echo patterns exactly matched the test shots fired in dealey plaza the warren supporters declared victory new research has shown that the report that dismissed the audio recording of the gunshots was itself deeply flawed and ignored evidence that confirmed both the location and time of the recording as being in dealey plaza at the time of the jfk assassination this means that the original house select committee on assassinations conclusion is the correct one there were at least five gunshots in dealey plaza two of them within  second of each other and at least one of the shots came from the grassy knoll update the deathbed confession of cia agent e howard hunt to his son on the jfk assassination update numerous witnesses had reported a large obvious exit wound in the back of kennedys head consistent with the reports of a gunshot from the grassy knoll the warren commission dismissed the exit wound and reports of a shooter on the grassy knoll and published in their report photographs of the back of kennedys head that showed no damage now it has been revealed that the warren commission did not publish the actual autopsy photos but substituted photos taken after morticians had reconstructed kennedys head an anticipation of a possible open casket viewing prior to the funeral  as had been done with lincoln 
although described as a mixup the simplest explanation is deliberate deception by the warren commission dan rathers fib 
dan rather at the time an unknown newscaster from a small market texas tv station viewed the zapruder film then described it to america on the cbs network as this recording of that broadcast shows rather lied to all of america in claiming that the head shot pushed john f kennedys head forward 
rather makes the claim that kennedys head rocketed forward at  in the above video he also makes a point of saying there were only three shots in total rathers meteoric rise to network status and stardom soon followed this broadcast when the zapruder film was finally shown publicly during jim garrisons trial of cia agent clay shaw rathers lie was revealed for all to see a revealing wink 
most americans who lived through the kennedy assassination are very familiar with the above photo of vice president lyndon johnson being sworn in as president aboard air force one 
but very few people are aware of another photograph snapped just seconds later

the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church 
but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons 
walshs ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church 
lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired 
at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency

this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen

the state of georgia is demanding copies of the sermons and related notes of a lay pastor who was fired by the department of public health after it investigated what he said in his church 
but dr eric walsh is resisting issuing a statement via his legal team that he will not comply with the demand from state lawyers 
the states demand is in response to a lawsuit filed by walsh against the department of health charging discrimination based on his religion and other civil rights violations 
hes getting support from a pastor who successfully fought off a demand by houston officials for copies of his sermons 
walshs ordeal began in may  when he accepted an offer as to become district health director with the state agency only a week later a state official asked him to provide copies of sermons he had preached as a lay minister with a seventhday adventist church 
lee rudd the agencys human resources director then assigned staff members to listen to the youtube recordings immediately two days later walsh was fired 
at that point lawyers with first liberty institute joined forces with the atlanta legal team of parks chesin  walbert to file a federal lawsuit against the state agency 
police state usa how orwells nightmare is becoming our reality chronicles how america has arrived at the point of being a de facto police state and what led to an outofcontrol government that increasingly ignores the constitution order today 
now in response to walshs lawsuit the state delivered a request for production of documents that demands among a flood of other paperwork copies of his sermon notes and transcripts 
this is an excessive display of the government overreaching its authority and violating the sanctity of the church said jeremy dys senior counsel for first liberty 
no government has the right to require a pastor to turn over his sermons said walsh in a statement released by his lawyers i cannot and will not give up my sermons unless i am forced to do so 
officials with the georgia department of health declined to respond to a wnd request for comment instead referring a reporter to the state attorney general who did not respond to a request for comment 
walshs lawyers scheduled a news conference as a display of support 
on the guest list was pastor dave welch of houston one of five pastors whose sermons were demanded by a lesbian mayor during her campaign to establish protections for her sexual preferences in city code 
wnd broke the story when the city launched its action against the pastors and also reported when rush limbaugh described parkers actions as possibly one of the most vile filthy blatant violations of the constitution that i have seen

have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own 
for the federal government its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar 
you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations 
now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve 
the irony here is thick indeed 
one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them 
meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital 
lynch wants reports 
so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave maryland ave and nd street only stills have been released video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger as doj claimed when he fired fatal shot to careys head not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer as the doj claimed police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey two from the capitol police and two from the secret service not one statement from those officers was in the report their names were also redacted redacted information an attorney in the washington dc mayors office said the only redactions were names in order to protect privacy it turned out much more was redacted than names the report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information  pages in the report were entirely blacked out  pages were mostly blacked out  pages were partially blacked out some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked evidence some just had a date witness statements an astonishing  witness accounts are missing from the police report the police report stated there were seventytwo  witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad of those  witness statements only  were in the materials provided to wnd leaving  missing statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk white house guard post video stills were released but not the video it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off or left at a normal speed as a witness said police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report 
i could go on and on for people who want facts and reports the us justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press 
weve been at this for a long time  years yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous unjustifiable outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that

"will it be representative government or thugocracy exclusive erik rush envisions clinton using high court as a bludgeon against liberty published  mins ago erik rush about   archive erik rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare his latest book is negrophilia from slave block to pedestal  americas racial obsession in  he was the first to give national attention to the story of sen barack obamas ties to militant chicago preacher rev jeremiah wright initiating a media feeding frenzy erik has appeared on fox news hannity and colmes cnn and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances print 
 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant 
in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates 
the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government

regrettably with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness 
even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong 
and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  
mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother 
during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage 
this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court 
its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations 
with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil 
history will reflect as much 
under a president hillary clinton millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president donald trump these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth 
the devil and democrats oh how they love derision and division within the body of christ",Fake
"election crossroads socialism or capitalism exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems living wage proposal published  mins ago jane chastain about   archive jane chastain is a southern californiabased broadcaster author and political commentator despite her present emphasis on politics jane always will be remembered as the nations first female tv sportscaster spending  years on the sports beat jane blogs at janechastaincom she is a pilot who lives on a private runway print 
our country is at a crossroads never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road one road the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues promises to lead us to a socialist utopia the other favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system in this system they control the lions share of our money and in turn hand out favors in this system they make the major decisions that affect our lives as the government accumulates more and more power we invariably end up with less statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power the more of our hardearned money he or she spends yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again expecting a different result 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world no it isnt perfect but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs which is around  a year in some parts of the country the democrats want to replace the minimum wage which is a training wage with this living wage that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently 
ideally it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does 
unfortunately this socalled living wage will destroy jobs it will cause companies to automate and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness 
this no doubt appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better 
wages have remained flat for far too long but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high such as weve seen in obamacare there is a large outcry thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear our benevolent government will take care of us they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve and if we dont get that job the government is going to give us free health care free food and free housing under president hillary there will be free child care free preschool and paid family leave what a country 
if we dont reach our goals everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement and if that isnt enough the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses they never talk about that 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom the other offers a free lunch

before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael browns alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",Fake

every ethnic group except whites blocvotes for the democrats coincidentally the democrats have brought in another  to  million nonwhite immigrants in the last few decades 
it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross 
the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants 
the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society 
look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family 
one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing 
when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing 
as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants 
thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling 
and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation 
immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled 
in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling 
somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing 
in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack 
when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   
needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all 
the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome 
by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex 
those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican 
that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team 
similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment 
perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good 
manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher 
our country will be zimbabwe but  if all goes according to the democrats plan  theyll get to be mugabe

two weeks left to go in the election and the electorate feels like a battered nfl fan the game gets increasingly old and tiring to watch and playing it can inflict permanent brain damage 
democrats can be counted upon to call the republican opponent racist whether the opponent is the priestly mitt romney or the supreme court justice who wrote the dred scott decision donald trump you see is racist because among other reasons at a campaign stop he pointed to a black man and called him my africanamerican hillary clinton on the other hand is not antisemitic even though three witnesses one of whom took and passed a polygraph claim that she referred to her husbands former congressional campaign manager as a fing jew bastard 
with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms 
in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms 
meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked 
five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least  percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed 
meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her 
hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney  speaks for me and that was that 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since  who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the chinese and whose media compadres including scribes with the new york times washington post and cnbc have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign and she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the united states receive larry elders commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elders alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",Fake

as i outlined in last weekends column we know that clintons emails were replete with classified information according to the fbi the classified emails included intelligence graded at the most closely guarded level eight topsecret emails and seven designated as special access program sap information while fbi director james comeys presentation understandably left this vague the likelihood is that seven of the eight topsecret emails are sap under president bill clintons  executive order topsecret intelligence is information the mishandling of which could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security the sap designation is added when the unauthorized disclosure of intelligence could compromise critical intelligencegathering methods or imperil the lives of intelligence sources

new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams the yearold who has claimed since the s to be the black son of former president bill clinton 
youtube citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines declared the account cannot be restored 
the youtube decision blocked the nineminute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams which had received  million views since williams posted it last week produced by filmmaker joel gilbert it drew nearly  views per day and more than  viewer comments with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity

my youtube account has been deleted but the same video appears in  other places on youtube alone williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision youtube cant handle the truth please share billclintonson 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page  but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated sorry about that 
the video is still running on danney williamsclintons facebook page  as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert 
attempt to silence danney williams 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines gilbert said 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  gilbert said 
danney cannot be silenced any longer he continued hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug but its not going to work this time his story is out there and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct  that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in  despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced 
clinton defenders since  have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time there was no match nothing even close 
but in an interview bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna bunton told wnd 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw new york 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media including the new york times wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back bunton recalled to wnd we thought it was going to turn out to be his son but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi 
twitter rules 
many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets including james okeefe and his project veritas which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct  twitter shut down his account  claiming violations of twitter rules the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules which prohibit harassing other users threatening other users disclosing other users private information or violating other rules in a statement okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public on monday okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube calling the apparent block bizarre earlier this month okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns the daily caller reported  project veritas posted an undercover video oct  proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube which google owns noted silenceisconsentnet  it did however trend on twitter which google does not own breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention for some  months the makers of the new movie im not ashamed about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in  were unable to promote their movie through youtube the trailer was taken down late in  and the movies entire channel was suspended

have you ever noticed how washington always has a plan to solve everybodys problem  except their own 
for the federal government its always easy and tempting to look at problems  real or imagined  outside of the beltway and solve them from afar 
you will recall of course how former attorney general eric holder was going to stop police shootings all over america with sensitivity training the power and force of the federal government and investigations investigations and more investigations 
now loretta lynch his successor also known as hillary clintons guardian angel is set to turn police shootings throughout america into big business and more power for washington 
her latest pet project is assembling a national database on interactions between law enforcement and civilians she reported this month 
accurate and comprehensive data on the use of force by law enforcement is essential to an informed and productive discussion about communitypolice relations lynch said in the days ahead the department of justice will continue to work alongside our local state tribal and federal partners to ensure that we put in place a system to collect data that is comprehensive useful and responsive to the needs of the communities we serve 
the irony here is thick indeed 
one of lynchs goals she says is to get law enforcement agencies to report more thoroughly about people who died during an interaction with them 
meanwhile lynch presides over the most egregious coverup of the most outrageous police shooting case i have ever seen in my life  namely the killing of miriam carey a young black mother with baby in tow who was gunned down by washington cops and secret service agents for a wrong turn in the nations capital 
lynch wants reports 
so does wnd which has been pursuing the information through freedom of information act requests and finally after being stonewalled for years a lawsuit 
so does the public and the family of miriam carey unfortunately lynch is holding back on a few things missing evidence the page memo with findings analysis of evidence and conclusions in the carey shooting investigation this would show the evidence and reasoning that led the department of justice to decline to file criminal charges against officers why they considered this a justifiable homicide  or whether they should have based on the evidence why officers used deadly force whether officers followed or violated the policy of their agencies video of shooting at capitol police guard post at intersection of constitution ave maryland ave and nd street only stills have been released video would show more clearly if officers life actually was in danger as doj claimed when he fired fatal shot to careys head not one of the five witnesses at the scene said carey was driving at the officer as the doj claimed police statements the police report said four officers fired shots at carey two from the capitol police and two from the secret service not one statement from those officers was in the report their names were also redacted redacted information an attorney in the washington dc mayors office said the only redactions were names in order to protect privacy it turned out much more was redacted than names the report was riddled with blackedout sections and missing information  pages in the report were entirely blacked out  pages were mostly blacked out  pages were partially blacked out some of the blackedout pages just included a heading marked evidence some just had a date witness statements an astonishing  witness accounts are missing from the police report the police report stated there were seventytwo  witnesses interviewed regarding this incident and their statements were captured by audio andor video recordings copies of the aforementioned recordings were turned over to the usao for review copies of the aforementioned audio and video recordings are stored in the main case file at the technical support unit tsu located at the iad of those  witness statements only  were in the materials provided to wnd leaving  missing statement transcripts none of the actual transcripts of interviews in the witnesses own words were provided just paraphrased versions in what the former nypd officer sanders described as cop talk white house guard post video stills were released but not the video it would show whether anyone was manning the post when carey drove up whether she tried to drive around the offduty guard who dragged a gate in front of her and whether she sped off or left at a normal speed as a witness said police radio recordings no recordings or transcripts of radio transmissions during the pursuit and shooting of carey were provided in the foia material also not provided were transcripts of computer transmissions instant messaging between squad cars and police headquarters ballistics and forensics reports the justice department washington metro police department responses to foia requests did not include a ballistics or a forensics report 
i could go on and on for people who want facts and reports the us justice department under both holder and lynch have a strong propensity for not willingly releasing the facts and reports to the public or the press 
weve been at this for a long time  years yet the stonewall and coverup of a horrendous unjustifiable outrageous police shooting right in their own jurisdiction and backyard continues 
do we really expect eric holder and loretta lynch to find justice for police shooting victims outside of their own jurisdiction with a track record like that

"will it be representative government or thugocracy exclusive erik rush envisions clinton using high court as a bludgeon against liberty published  mins ago about   archive erik rush is a columnist and author of sociopolitical fare his latest book is negrophilia from slave block to pedestal  americas racial obsession in  he was the first to give national attention to the story of sen barack obamas ties to militant chicago preacher rev jeremiah wright initiating a media feeding frenzy erik has appeared on fox news hannity and colmes cnn and is a veteran of numerous radio appearances print 
 i feel strongly that the supreme court needs to stand on the side of the american people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy for me that means that we need a supreme court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the lgbt community that will stand up and say no to citizens united a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system  
 hillary clinton 
the first salvo from democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton or rather her answer to the first question posed by fox news chris wallace to her and donald trump at the third presidential debate was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy 
those on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing dog whistle politics rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition ms clintons response to wallaces question where they wanted to see the supreme court take the country and their views on how the constitution ought to be interpreted however was representative of this tactic 
while womens rights and those of the lgbt community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court since objectively women wouldnt appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president and the lgbt community accounts for less than  percent of the american population clintons answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress 
womens rights is of course dog whistle for unfettered abortion even lateterm abortion which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment lgbt rights is dog whistle for disenfranchising the majority of americans who hold traditional values primarily christians leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of christians in europe and canada a direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the us at least not at present however judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result 
let us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the constitution and that clintons overall objectives are manifestly evil hillary clintons stated priorities for the supreme court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the constitution and individual liberties rather than allowing it to perform its designated function the hypocrisy attendant to clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see despite being conveniently ignored by the press 
clintons reference to powerful corporations and the wealthy and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization citizens united was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy clinton is quite wealthy and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of american socialists even if citizens united were a vehicle for dark unaccountable money the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the muslim brotherhood with which bill and hillary clinton have been partnered for decades or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by george soros the former nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in america someone with whom the clintons also have a long association 
one need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind clintons debate rhetoric to discern what a hillary clinton presidency might look like her actions to date  and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office  should suffice quite nicely despite the craven complicity of the establishment press mainstream media there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the democratic leviathan supporting her and which facilitated barack obamas rise to power are fundamentally malignant 
in recent days weve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality thats been brought to bear in getting clinton elected from democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of clintons popularity to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the clinton campaign the democratic national committee and the white house 
the bottom line here is that hillary clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality what all americans  not just voters and not just republicans  need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the republican party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the democratic party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and yes even vote for their candidates 
the burning question is this in the end are we to be governed by the will of the people or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government

"while democrats perpetually circle the wagons republicans engage a perpetual circular firing squad the same holds true for many evangelicals democrats and secularists count on it 
and we never disappoint 
full disclosure i went from a dogged never trumper to a maybe trumper and finally settled as a reluctant trumper i like any godfearing father of daughters was and remain appalled by donald trumps sordid past and his yearold vulgar video in which he objectified women his words are indefensible and i fully expect the clinton camp to strategically release additional revolting and embarrassing opposition research about the republican nominee before election day 
still i will be voting against hillary clinton on nov  in what is objectively and irrefutably the most effective way possible by casting a vote for better or worse for the policies and promises of donald trump  and for the vice presidency of gov mike pence 
regrettably with many of my never trump friends im reminded of the fanatic who refuses his daughter chemotherapy and watches her die in an effort to convince himself and others of the strength of his own faith pride is an awful thing we are to be wise as serpents and innocent as doves matthew  foolishness called faith is just foolishness 
even so there are christian pharisees on both extremes of this trump fiasco first those trumpian cultists who buy the make america great again pablum and deride any person who while not casting judgment upon others makes with all sincerity what they view as the principled decision the latter say theyll sit this one out or go through the motions by voting third party  a wasted vote by any objective standard while i appreciate this milder strain of never trumpers sincerity i nonetheless believe it is sincerely wrong 
and then there are the selfrighteous plankintheeye never trump prigs who slander as having lost their saltinesssinned against god and compromised their principles brothers and sisters who recognize the empirical reality that a vote for a horribly flawed lord knows im the worst sinner of all baby christian as president is a vote against hillary clintons tyranny in perpetuity 
the media research center has done america a tremendous service in  the watchdog organization released a video of an actual partial birth abortion  something hillary clinton stood on stage during the final presidential debate stared into the camera with cold callous eyes and then both lied about and defended unequivocally i plead with never trumpers to watch the video and then prayerfully reassess their plans for nov  
mrs clintons beloved lateterm abortion practice is one so brutal and needless that even the leftleaning american medical association has admitted that it is dangerous to the mother and never necessary under any circumstances not the least of which is for the life or health of the mother 
during a partialbirth abortion the abortionist pulls a fully viable child  often kicking and thrashing  feet first from her mothers womb leaving only the top of her head in the birth canal this is so the abortionist can technically claim to be performing an abortion rather than committing murder 
he then stabs the child through the base of her skull with scissors piercing her brain until her kicking and moving about suddenly and violently jerks to a halt next he opens the scissors to enlarge the wound as blood and brainstem fluid gush down his hands inserts a vacuum tube and sucks out her brains thereby collapsing her skull 
her now limp and lifeless body is then cast away like so much garbage 
this is homicide plain and simple hillary clinton supports it donald trump opposes it 
we deserve gods wrath and judgment as a nation for allowing this abortion holocaust to occur on our watch in my estimation mrs clinton is a bloodthirsty monster who enthusiastically supports this barbarity her supreme court appointees will ensure that tens of millions of precious babies like the one in the video are murdered in the same brutal manner 
my conscience tells me that i must vote in such a way that exercising my civic duty will have the strongest net effect against mrs clinton and ensure that she is stopped she must not be elected president to not vote  or to vote for a nonstarter third party candidate which is effectively the same thing  while not an actual vote for mrs clinton still puts this mengele in a pantsuit one step closer to the white house and the supreme court 
its simple math and its undeniable the most effective thing you can personally do as a citizen is to vote against mrs clinton by voting for mr trump this does the most electoral damage possible to candidate clinton and offers the best chance for life that you can provide future generations 
with its  roe v wade decision the us supreme court put the governments official stamp of approval on mass murder since then the battle lines have been drawn this is war prochoicers are the bad guys and prolifers the good guys it really is that simple  that black and white its good versus evil 
history will reflect as much 
under a president hillary clinton millions more babies will be tortured and dismembered alive under a president donald trump these millions might live and yet even as hillary sharpens her knives we quibble like fools over donalds potty mouth 
the devil and democrats oh how they love derision and division within the body of christ",Fake
"election crossroads socialism or capitalism exclusive jane chastain explains impact of dems living wage proposal published  mins ago about   archive jane chastain is a southern californiabased broadcaster author and political commentator despite her present emphasis on politics jane always will be remembered as the nations first female tv sportscaster spending  years on the sports beat jane blogs at janechastaincom she is a pilot who lives on a private runway print 
our country is at a crossroads never before have we faced such an obvious fork in the road one road the one favored by politician hillary clinton and her democratic colleagues promises to lead us to a socialist utopia the other favored by businessman donald trump and some of his republican colleagues promises to get us back on the road toward freemarket capitalism 
it is no secret that most career politicians lean toward a socialist system in this system they control the lions share of our money and in turn hand out favors in this system they make the major decisions that affect our lives as the government accumulates more and more power we invariably end up with less statistics show that the longer a politician stays in power the more of our hardearned money he or she spends yet we keep electing the same people over and over and over again expecting a different result 
weve been headed down the road toward socialism for quite some time and this could be the last fork in the road we will have to get us back to the freemarket system that has given this country the highest standard of living in the world no it isnt perfect but it works for everyone who is willing to work hard and wants to improve his or her life 
notice what i didnt say is simply willing to work hard there is the belief by some that if you simply work hard you should have what these politicians now call a living wage  the income necessary to support a family of four and supply all its basic needs which is around  a year in some parts of the country the democrats want to replace the minimum wage which is a training wage with this living wage that completely kicks the bottom rungs out from under the economic ladder americans have traditionally climbed to reach their goals and live independently 
ideally it would mean that you could take a job flipping hamburgers and never gain any skills or accept any responsibility and live as comfortably as the guy or gal who does 
unfortunately this socalled living wage will destroy jobs it will cause companies to automate and those that cannot will begin moving offshore at an even faster rate 
but this living wage is only part of what the democrats want to do in the name of fairness 
this no doubt appeals to many in this poor economy who have lost all hope so they are lulled into thinking that the socialist road is much better 
wages have remained flat for far too long but the democrats are proposing raising taxes even higher on businesses and job creators 
most people simply do not understand that businesses dont pay taxes they are passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices and when the price of the necessary goods and services becomes too high such as weve seen in obamacare there is a large outcry thats when the government steps in and takes over the means of production and the control of those services thats when the door to socialismcommunism slams shut 
they tell us if we take this socialist road there is nothing to fear our benevolent government will take care of us they are offering us free college  or almost free loans  in order to get the job we want at a salary we think we deserve and if we dont get that job the government is going to give us free health care free food and free housing under president hillary there will be free child care free preschool and paid family leave what a country 
if we dont reach our goals everything will be ok because social security and medicare will be there to finance our retirement and if that isnt enough the government will put us in a retirement center where we live out the remainder of our years playing checkers or watching television 
what about the fact that social security and medicare are going broke how long can we keep printing money to keep us afloat before our economy collapses they never talk about that 
as british prime minister margaret thatcher once said the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money 
dont be fooled this election is about a lot more than the two personalities at the top of the ticket its an important fork in the road one fork requires hard work and sacrifice but offers freedom the other offers a free lunch

"print 
before you applaud me for my integrity or condemn me for selling out allow me to explain my decision to vote for donald trump on nov  
first im writing this because i have been asked incessantly for months how i would be voting not because i think im someone special or that what i do should influence you 
second im not endorsing donald trump in my mind theres a world of difference between endorsing a candidate and voting for a candidate 
third i respect those in the nevertrump camp and share many of their concerns including the possibility of his further vulgarizing and degrading the nation the possibility of him deepening our ethnic and racial divides and the possibility of him alienating our allies and unnecessarily provoking our enemies just to name a few among the nevertrump voices i respect are columnists like david french and ben shapiro bloggers like matt walsh and evangelical leaders like russell moore and beth moore 
fourth i take strong exception to evangelicals who have fawned over trump as if he were some kind of savior figure supporting him as if he were st donald i also take issue with evangelical leaders who want us to minimize some of trumps failings constantly saying let him who is without sin cast the first one see john  this is not a question of condemning the man but rather a question of making a moral assessment as to his readiness to serve our nation 
fifth my decision to vote for trump barring something earthshattering between now and nov  is consistent with my position which has been  during the gop primaries i issued strong warnings against voting for trump while we had other excellent choices i did this in writing  on video and on the radio but always stating that if trump won the nomination i would reevaluate my position  once trump became the republican candidate i wrote that i was rooting for him to take steps in the right direction and thereby win my vote  i have stated repeatedly that under no circumstances would i vote for hillary for two strong warnings about hillary see here and here  
so what has convinced me that i should now vote for donald trump 
the culture war is not over gain hope courage and practical advice in michael browns latest book outlasting the gay revolution where homosexual activism is really going and how to turn the tide 
first i believe that he actually is serious about appointing prolife proconstitution supreme court justices when he said during the last debate that if youre prolife you want to see roe v wade overturned and when he reiterated at his gettysburg speech that he will be drawing from his list of  potential appointees he helped me feel more confident that he would not suddenly flipflop if elected 
second one reason i endorsed sen ted cruz was because he took on the political establishment both democratic and republican to the point of calling it the washington cartel trump is an absolute wrecking ball to the negative parts of the political system although unfortunately hes been a wrecking ball to some of the good parts of the system so my vote for him is also a protest vote 
third i am voting for the republican platform not the republican party which means im in agreement with the platform while at the same time having very little confidence in the party as a whole 
fourth while i have always felt that the line were electing a president not a pastor was overstated and superficial if we rephrased it to say were electing a general to train handtohand combat warriors not a pastor it might have more relevance in other words we are not looking for trump to be a moral reformer even if hedoes appoint righteous judges and at this point he certainly is anything but a moral example although we pray he will be truly converted and become one rather out of our choices for president which are stark we are voting for the one most likely to defeat hillary and make some good decisions for the nation not be the savior and with things so messed up in america the handtohand combat analogy is closer to home 
fifth within the first few minutes of the last debate the massive differences between hillary and trump were there for the world to see she a proabortion radical and an extreme supporter of the lgbt agenda and he unashamedly speaking out against lateterm abortions and wanting to appoint justices who would defend our essential liberties since i have the opportunity to vote i feel that i should vote for trump 
sixth trump continues to be drawn to conservative christians and not just ones who tickle his ears one of my dear friends has spent hours with trump and members of his family and he has told me that in  years of ministry no one has received him as openly and graciously as has trump yet my friend continues to speak the truth to him in the clearest possible terms while i am not one of those claiming that trump is a bornagain christian i see absolutely no evidence of this the fact that he continues to listen to godly men and open the door to their counsel indicates that something positive could possibly be going on it also indicates that these godly leaders might be a positive influence on him if he were elected president 
seventh although im quite aware that a president could do great harm or good to the nation im far more concerned with what we as gods people do with our own lives and witnesses and for me the state of the church of america is much more important than the state of the white house in that context i echo the words and warning of dr martin luther king jr the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool if the church does not recapture its prophetic zeal it will become an irrelevant social club without moral or spiritual authority 
so in sum  my hope is in god not donald trump and i do recognize that either hillary or trump has the potential to do great harm to america  my urgent call is for us as followers of jesus to get our own act together so we can be the salt and light of the nation  i will continue to urge all believers not to vote for hillary clinton whose policies will certainly do us great harm and  ultimately the most effective way to defeat hillary is to vote for trump while also praying that god will use him for good  not for evil 
in the end if trump gets elected and fails miserably i will be grieved but not devastated if he does well i will rejoice 
either way though my vote is just that a vote my greater role is to live a life pleasing to god with the hope of advancing a gospelbased moral and cultural revolution receive michael browns commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for michael browns alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",Fake

it doesnt help that white voters cant agree on what constitutes an acceptable candidate in  workingclass whites sat out the election rather than vote for the outoftouch rich guy they saw in mitt romney this year the outoftouch rich guys say theyll vote for hillary because trump is tacky and gross 
the sad irony is that the only people who will be better off in our new country are mostly white plutocrats  the top  percent the rest of us will be their servants 
the people who will be worse off are everybody else  the working class the middle class who will soon be working class and most of all women minorities children the elderly the weakest and most vulnerable members of society 
look to mexico for your future  or any third world country or to univisions jorge ramos the ruling class in mexico is composed of europeanlooking white descendants of spanish conquistadors who raped the native population giving them only their spanish names in return british settlers in america brought women with them 
explaining latino cultures acceptance of incest and child rape criminal justice researcher shana maier writes in a book about rape that the male is the head of the household and women are subordinate to men  hispanics and latinos are more likely than other racialethnic groups to blame the victim the victim not the perpetrator is blamed for bringing dishonor to the family 
one american detective said that today police are being taught to keep an open mind about child rape because its a cultural thing 
when it comes to multiculturalism you cant say we love the empanadas  but we dont want yearold men raping their nieces  this isnt an a la carte menu we get all the attributes of the cultures were importing 
as described in excruciating detail in adios america the lefts plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole our media already have a totally open mind about incest and child rape  and murder  when its committed by immigrants 
thus for example where i would have chosen the headline illegal alien convicted of incest child rape the chattanooga tenn times free press went with the less catchy man guilty in case of human smuggling 
and where i would have used the headline illegal alien repeatedly raped yearold girl at job site the commercial dispatch in columbus mississippi went with the more subtle columbus resident charged with molestation 
immigrant women arrive in america thrilled to have escaped cultures where rape incest and spousal murder are acceptable only to discover that those crimes are perfectly acceptable in this country too  provided the perpetrator is from the very culture they fled 
in  brooklyn judge edward pincus sentenced a chinese immigrant to probation for a premeditated murder of his wife on the grounds that the murder flowed from traditional chinese values about adultery and loss of manhood the female head of the asianamerican legal defense and education fund margaret fung applauded the ruling 
somewhat amazingly newspapers are more likely to report black crime than immigrant crime anything to keep the third world immigration flowing 
in  a yearold girl was gangraped by about a dozen illegal aliens who cheered and videoed the attack 
when the news first broke shaneequa jupiter who lived with her children in the apartment building where the gang rape occurred complained that neither the police nor apartment security had warned residents about the danger that could reflect poorly on illegal immigrants 
even if shaneequa had scoured the headlines she would have been on the lookout for austin men or two 
compare these headlines about the same brutal sexual attack 
 two held in attack on child  austin americanstatesman texas july   
 two mexicans placed on immigration detainers as third man is arrested over fiveday gang rape hell of teenage runaway during which she smoked crack  daily mail online july   
needless to say the new york times did not cover the mexican illegalalien gang rape at all 
the ultimate primer on the bluecollar billionaire order ann coulters book in trump we trust e pluribus awesome 
by contrast the times and every major american news outlet extensively covered another gang rape  of a girl about the same age at about the same time in about the same place 
the second case only was rape because of the girls young age  she was  but she was an enthusiastic participant sneaking out of her house at night to meet the men for sex 
those rapes just a few years earlier got a fullcourt press the defendants were africanamerican the victim was mexican 
that time there were articles in the huffington post gq slate salon and mother jones it even made the new york times despite no connection to a college fraternity or lacrosse team 
similarly within a few months of one another in  two men were arrested in separate child rape cases in decatur alabama for assaults on yearold girls one suspect was africanamerican the other was a hispanic immigrant only one made the newspaper guess which one 
when excitable muslims raped american reporter lara logan in tahrir square another one of hillarys foreign policy successes journalists immediately set to work to find the shortest line from the muslim rapists to white american men 
conclusion the real problem was the female reporters american bosses and colleagues definitely not islam 
sampling of new york times commentary on logans rape 
 why we need women in war zones i would never tell my bosses for fear that they might keep me at home the next time something major happened  this attack also had nothing to do with islam 
 reporting while female women reporters face another set of challenges we are often harassed in ways that male colleagues are not  in my experience muslim countries were not the worst places for sexual harassment 
perhaps american men could do better but as american women may soon discover they never had it so good 
manifestly the purpose of our immigration policies is not to help americans  or the immigrants who wanted to live in a place like america they are designed to funnel welfaredependent voters to the democrats and cheap labor to the rich the chinese immigrant who got probation for murdering his wife for example came to america based on his specialized skill of being a dishwasher

with a republican candidate the media can be counted upon to seize upon any deficiencies  big or small real or imagined  while giving the democrat a pass so trumps failure to ever apologize outweighs an examination of clintons flatout lie during the third debate when she insisted that the supreme court heller case was about toddlers as opposed to the fundamental issue of whether the second amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms 
in heller nowhere in the majority decision or in any of the dissenting decisions does the word toddler appear clinton a year ago flatout said the supreme court is wrong on the second amendment to normal people this meant she opposed what the decision ruled on which again was whether we as individuals have a right to keep and bear arms 
meanwhile we learn more and more about what the media labels an email scandal when the accurate description is national security scandal the espionage act criminalizes gross negligence in the handling of important national security matters the law does not require as fbi director james comey falsely stated an intent nor is it relevant as clinton insists whether or not her private server the one she maintained in her basement was hacked 
five people who worked with or for clinton including her chief of staff all received immunity deals something normally given to get someone to flip on a target some of the five were involved in deleting emails after the emails were subpoenaed but the target that is to say hillary clinton was deemed by comey to have lacked sufficient criminal intent to be prosecuted so why the immunity deals who knows  and as far as most of the media are concerned who cares 
clinton insists that president obama doesnt get enough credit for the swell job he did with the economy this would be the economy in which for the first time in history a president has presided over a recovery without a single year of at least  percent growth in gross domestic product this would be the same economy with an alleged low unemployment number that gallup ceo jim clifton calls the big lie given the large number of people who simply abandoned the job hunt or are underemployed 
meanwhile its yet another day in which another woman who alleges she was kissed groped touched or made fun of by trump has appeared with her attorney feminist gloria allred allred a clinton supporter sees no contradiction between representing alleged victims of trumps sexual misconduct and her support for clinton who is alleged to have hired private detectives and lawyers to dig up dirt on her husbands accusers one such accuser juanita broaddrick claims not only that she was raped by bill clinton but also that two weeks after the alleged rape hillary clinton verbally threatened her 
hillary clinton mind you has never been asked by anyone in the media about broaddricks allegation never and only one national reporter sam donaldson has ever asked bill clinton about juanita broaddricks allegation ever clintons answer he referred donaldson to his lawyer david kendall donaldson quickly tried again asking the thenpresident to simply deny it same answer my attorney  speaks for me and that was that 
so hillary clinton is a candidate who wants to continue the same policy thats given us the worst recovery since  who has clearly violated the espionage act and placed the nations security at risk who told the benghazi victims families that the death of four americans was inspired by a video while telling her daughter and foreign officials something entirely different whose charitable foundation engaged in paytoplay in haiti so that donors got contracts for disaster relief and nondonors went to the back of the line who wants to gut the second amendment who wants to continue the same foreign policies that that have encouraged aggressiveness on the part of isis russia and the chinese and whose media compadres including scribes with the new york times washington post and cnbc have been outed by wikileaks as colluding with her campaign and she is now oddson favorite to become the next president of the united states receive larry elders commentaries in your email bonus by signing up for larry elders alerts you will also be signed up for news and special offers from wnd via email name",Fake

"print sidebyside of bill clinton and danney williams 
new york youtube on wednesday suspended the account of danney williams the yearold who has claimed since the s to be the black son of former president bill clinton 
youtube citing repeated or severe violations of our terms of use andor community guidelines declared the account cannot be restored 
the youtube decision blocked the nineminute feature banished  the untold story of danney williams which had received  million views since williams posted it last week produced by filmmaker joel gilbert it drew nearly  views per day and more than  viewer comments with the overwhelming majority expressing support for williams and outrage at the clintons for not being willing to allow a dna test to determine paternity 
like the reporting you see here sign up for free news alerts from wndcom americas independent news network 
my youtube account has been deleted but the same video appears in  other places on youtube alone williams said on his facebook page after being notified of youtubes decision youtube cant handle the truth please share billclintonson 
twitter also continues to allow williams to post the banished video on danney williams page  but the twitter link to youtube displays the message  this video is no longer available because the youtube account associated with this video has been terminated sorry about that 
the video is still running on danney williamsclintons facebook page  as well as on the youtube channel operated by gilbert 
attempt to silence danney williams 
gilbert told wnd he helped williams file an online appeal form on youtube asking why the account was suspended and demanding it be immediately reinstated 
the behavior of youtubegoogle in suspending danneys account is outrageous there have been absolutely zero violations of any kind let alone a severe one of any youtube terms or guidelines gilbert said 
gilbert was outspoken in charging youtube with partisan political motives for the suspension 
the only possible explanation is that the clinton campaign requested youtubegoogle to silence danney to run him off the plantation as danney said hillary clinton did to him and his aunt when he was a small child and they were chased off the grounds of the arkansas governors mansion in  gilbert said 
danney cannot be silenced any longer he continued hillary may try to sweep danney williams under the rug but its not going to work this time his story is out there and every day more and more people understand bill and hillary clinton banished this young man from their family because of the color of his skin 
see the danney williams video feature 
wnd reported oct  that in the hours before the third and final presidential debate attorneys for williams were in las vegas to announce their intention to file a paternity suit demanding dna evidence from the former president 
accompanying the dramatic announcement was a rap music video celebrating williams that went viral on the internet 
no definitive dna test 
wnd reported that no dna test was conducted in  despite media reports to the contrary when williams claim first surfaced 
clinton defenders since  have contended the tabloid star magazine conducted a dna showdown proving bill clinton was not williams father citing star magazine editor phil bunton saying at the time there was no match nothing even close 
but in an interview bunton told wnd that no blood sample was obtained from clinton and star magazine never published a story documenting a laboratory test 
i dont remember ever seeing any laboratory test that was done on clintons dna bunton told wnd 
bunton is now the owner of the rivertown magazine in haverstraw new york 
he affirmed to wnd that the tabloid relied on the dna evidence for clinton published by independent counsel kenneth starr extracted from the infamous monica lewinsky blue dress 
we got a lot of phone calls from several people in the media including the new york times wanting to know when we were going to get the dna back bunton recalled to wnd we thought it was going to turn out to be his son but when the dna came back there was no story there even to write 
the dna test released by kenneth starr was the second of two dna laboratory tests the fbi had run on clinton but the public record leaves no doubt that starr withheld the more robust test conducted by the fbi 
twitter rules 
many other figures who have challenged the democratic party or the leftleaning media narrative also have run into trouble with social media outlets including james okeefe and his project veritas which has exposed clinton campaign voter fraud and agitation in a series of hiddencamera videos just as okeefe was preparing to release new revelations of voter fraud oct  twitter shut down his account  claiming violations of twitter rules the notice said he must delete the tweets that are in violation of our rules which prohibit harassing other users threatening other users disclosing other users private information or violating other rules in a statement okeefe said he relies on social media to bypass the media and directly reach the public on monday okeefe wrote in a tweet project veritas was unable to upload its third video in the series to youtube calling the apparent block bizarre earlier this month okeefe was forced to delete a tweet critical of a hillary clinton staffer to regain use of his account after it was suspended for a day his account was suspended in the hours before a release of a new hiddencamera video that exposed a clinton ally saying she could use executive action on guns the daily caller reported  project veritas posted an undercover video oct  proving hillary clinton supporters were inciting violence at donald trump rallies to gain negative media coverage millions of viewers watched the video in just a few hours but it didnt show up on googles trending list on youtube which google owns noted silenceisconsentnet  it did however trend on twitter which google does not own breitbart blogger milo yiannopoulos was suspended permanently by twitter minutes before his gays for trump party at the republican national convention for some  months the makers of the new movie im not ashamed about the first victim of the columbine killers in colorado in  were unable to promote their movie through youtube the trailer was taken down late in  and the movies entire channel was suspended

"judge warns of dangers of appointed judiciary unelected and unaccountable  rule on their empathetic feelings published  mins ago about   archive bob unruh joined wnd in  after nearly three decades with the associated press as well as several upper midwest newspapers where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists he is also a photographer whose scenic work has been used commercially print 
a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced 
moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family 
before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional 
the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law 
mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group 
the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary 
daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america 
how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution 
samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it 
the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority 
for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way 
they refused 
then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people 
as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned 
rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage 
at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation

richardson writes 
kevin stuart executive director of the austin institute said fathers are natural teachers of baseball because it takes two to play catch 
there is a longstanding connection between fatherhood and baseball mr stuart said pointing to famous fatherson tandems who have played in the major leagues and the prominence of fatherson relationships in popular baseball movies such as field of dreams 
baseball he said was made to be played by fathers and sons 
baseball seems to fall somewhere in the middle where whats really necessary or what appears to us to be necessary in order to really improve skills is at least one other person deeply and personally committed on a regular basis to working with you mr stuart said 
anecdotal evidence seems to corroborate the studys connection between fatherhood and baseball 
famous fatherson tandems  including ken griffey sr and ken griffey jr prince fielder and cecil fielder and tony gwynn sr and tony gwynn jr  have talked about how the game was handed down from one generation to the next 
hero received a powerful endorsement from renowned christian author stormie omartian 
for such a time as this hero is an important movie about the estranged relationship between a father and his son who learn how to reconcile using faith and baseball farah said

a member of the increasingly divided and disputatious alabama supreme court is warning that judges need to be elected and thus accountable to the voters or their decisions end up being based on their empathetic feelings instead of the law 
alabamas judges are elected and accountable wrote justice tom parker this week federal judges as recently noted by chief justice roberts in his dissent in obergefell v hodges  a case in which five lawyers on the united states supreme court announced a fundamental right to samesex marriage are unaccountable and unelected 
he pointed out that three of the four dissenting us supreme court justices in obergefell noted on eight different occasions that the five lawyers who decided obergefell were unelected chief justice roberts said on two occasions that those unelected five lawyers were consequently unaccountable 
parker previously commented that the five lawyers failed to base their decision on legal reasoning history tradition the courts own rules or the rule of law but upon their empathetic feelings 
obergefell is the product of unelected and unaccountable judges he said 
he was arguing over a decision by the state court on its next move in a case brought by chief justice roy moore who was suspended for his actions regarding a marriagebased case that the court was reviewing when the obergefell case which created samesex marriage nationwide was announced 
moore who is challenging the punishment insisted that the state court justices who previously were involved in his case recuse themselves they did with the exception of the acting chief justice who was allowed to work with the governor to pick a panel of retired judges to hear moores arguments 
parker said active judges should have been included in the panel because retired judges too are unelected and unaccountable 
unelected and unaccountable judges are empowered to impose their agenda instead of faithfully applying the rule of law parker warned obergefell is not the first case concerning samesex marriage to prove this principle true before the united states supreme court decided obergefell the constitutionality of state laws defining marriage as between one man and one woman had been litigated before numerous courts throughout the united states 
dont miss phyllis schlaflys book now available autographed at the wnd superstore who killed the american family 
before obergefell  states passed laws affirming traditional marriage in  of those states the traditional marriage laws were challenged in the courts as unconstitutional of the  state laws affirming traditional marriage that were challenged in the courts  of those laws were struck down by the judiciary as unconstitutional each of the  courts that struck down the traditional marriage laws as unconstitutional was composed of judges who were unelected and thus unacountable 
he explained what happens when activist judges are held to account citing the situation that developed in iowa 
the supreme court of iowa was one of the unelected courts that struck down iowas traditional marriage law as unconstitutional the judges of the supreme court of iowa are appointed by the governor of iowa however although the judges are initially appointed they must stand for retention elections once their initial term expires 
he explained that after the iowa legislature adopted onemanonewoman marriage as law in april  in a decision largely viewed as judicial activism the supreme court of iowa unanimously overruled the democratic will of the people of iowa and held the law unconstitutional 
the very next year three of the judges  who had concurred in varnum had to stand for a retention election all three were removed from office by vote of the people of iowa this was the first time since iowa adopted its retentionelection system that any judge had ever failed to be retained the people of iowa held accountable those judges who failed to uphold the rule of law 
mathew staver chairman of of liberty counsel which is representing moore said huge questions remain of impropriety regarding the judicial systems handling of moores case 
chief justice moore is merely asking for the same thing any citizen is entitled to receive  equal justice under the law he wants his case to be heard by an objective and fair panel of judges who will adhere to the rule of law he said 
the people of alabama have increasingly called upon their judges to be accountable at every turn this case presents new twists and turns that have never occurred in the history of alabama never has there been a requirement that replacement judges all be retired we hope this case moves quickly to a final and just resolution the court of the judiciary violated the law when it suspended chief justice moore for life even though it lacked the  vote never before under the unanimity requirement of coj rule  has any judge ever been suspended for the rest of the term a sexting judge gets six months and a judge who writes a fourpage order that is not unethical or unlawful gets suspended for life this is not right 
supporters of moore also have filed an ethics complaint against lyn stuart who has been acting as alabamas chief justice 
she is accused of violating multiple cannons of ethics in her mishandling of the cases surrounding chief justice roy moore 
the complaint comes from the sanctity of marriage alabama organization 
if the judicial inquiry commission really cares about ethics fairness and upholding the integrity and impartiality of the alabama judiciary they will no doubt take our complaint seriously as will organizations which filed ethics complaints on chief justice moore said tom ford a spokesman for the group 
the complaints the group said outline how acting chief justice lyn stuart has repeatedly failed to avoid impropriety or the appearance of impropriety failed to perform the duties of her office impartially failed to avoid conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute and failed to conduct herself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary 
parker was not the first to cite the dangers of the judiciary 
daniel horowitz  senior editor at conservative review told wnd that the nation is going through a social transformation without representation 
it is the unelected branches of government that are deciding our most important issues whether its the bureaucrats whether its the courts and as it relates to even religious liberty even property rights immigration our voting rights who gets to vote he said 
horowitz tackles the topic of social transformation without representation in his book stolen sovereignty how to stop unelected judges from transforming america 
how did we get here horowitz asked rhetorically and the sad reality is nobody ever voted for this this was all foisted upon the people by unelected judges the legal profession and unelected bureaucrats that is social transformation without representation which as scalia warned is something much worse than even taxation without representation that served as the impetus for our first american revolution 
samesex marriage was mandated for the nation in  by the bare  majority made up of anthony kennedy ruth ginsburg stephen breyer sonia sotomayor and elena kagan john roberts clarence thomas samuel alito and the late antonin scalia opposed it 
the majority found in the constitution a right to samesex marriage overturning millennia of established legal precedent regarding marriage as well as the will of tens of millions of voters in dozens of states 
it elicited remarkably harsh criticism of the five justices in the us supreme court majority 
for one two of the justices in the majority kagan and ginsburg were asked to recuse themselves from the case because they had openly advocated for samesex marriage apparently violating standards to preserve judicial impartiality without their votes the case would have gone the other way 
they refused 
then there was the us supreme courts own opinion just two years earlier in the defense of marriage act case in which the court said states have exclusive power over marriage 
and there also are those who point out that the constitution doesnt mention marriage but does dictate that everything not mentioned in the document is left to the states and the people 
as wnd reported  ginsburg who voted in favor of samesex marriage has performed samesex wedding ceremonies and made supportive public statements justice elena kagan also has performed samesex weddings and promoted gay rights at harvards law school while she was at its helm 
critics contend the two justice appear to be violating judicial ethics rules that require recusal from a case in which there is even the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the foundation for moral law asked the justices to excuse themselves from the case but they refused to acknowledge the request the foundation explained that canon a of the code of conduct for united states judges provides a judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court  usc sec a mandates that a justice shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned 
rabbi jonathan cahn author of the new york times bestseller the harbinger and the inspiration behind the isaiah  judgment movie has criticized the supreme courts assumption that it has the authority to redefine marriage 
at a prayer event in washington he said the justices of the supreme court took up their seats in a hearing on whether they should strike down the biblical and historic definition of marriage that the event should even take place is a sign this is america of george washingtons warning  a nation at war against its own foundation 
washington warned the smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself hath ordained 
justices can you judge the ways of god there is another court and there is another judge where all men and all judges will give account he warned 
if a nations high court should pass judgment on the almighty should you then be surprised god will pass judgment on the court and that nation we are doing that which israel did on the altars of baal he said

when judith gait met father x it was a lopsided grief that drew them together he had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago gait is a married mother of five and longterm american resident in britain her support of the prolife movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her christian faith 
witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing subtle and working entirely with symbolism these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion rather they mourn in color symbol and tone with single shoes broken cord dead flowers and other lonely and broken things troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
when a friend first visited gaits studio he was struck by her abortion paintings confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child he wrote i realize your work comes from a place of great love for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture 
gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child it happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby five years to the day father x remembers every detail 
their conversation grew into a joint effort culminating in a book  troubadours sailing hibiscus seas meditations on post abortion trauma  father x wanted to remain anonymous as a placesetter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion he wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of gaits  paintings in this book which have also been shown together in art exhibits 
time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion gait claims rather the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence guilt and remorse has not abated you can see that in the words of father x which run the gamut of human emotions on abortion shoe pot and crossesfrom troubadours sailing hibiscus seas 
jonah of nineveh features an upended single rose with red cords and funereal foliage flowers are already in the birth position head down and waiting to be born torn and shroudlike ribbons hang across the painting spirals represent a childs dna helix and the veil of the temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation father x makes an analogy between jonah fleeing parental responsibility and eventual redemption  then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness it was her wedding dress my sea green empress this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives she was full of fear  
in some of these works hammers incongruently hang with flowers they are bloody or blackened some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose father x interprets these tools as decision markers to either build or tear down in hammer of decision it belongs to thor the war god infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction wagner the olympics sperm races thomas moore and valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author either the carpenters hammer of wisdom or thors tool of chaos will be chosen by expectant parents hammer suspended 
 troubadours  runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities this includes moonlighting for angels celestial games interstellar windjammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas among other delightful prospects lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their limbos 
father x occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters these are not theological statements but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion 
in gaits pink rose and stardust we see empty fields withered plants and other tokens father x takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children he places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles which is reflected in the painting children are disfigured or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents music is intense equivalent to the sound created by hildegard von bingen a thcentury nun and composer troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
references to mary as a mother are common as well as other scriptural allusions all babies jump for jesus in the womb or in its sack of nibbling yoke writes father x elizabeths child john leapt for joy just as his ancestor david did before the ark of the covenant he continues 
gait addresses the human embryo finding biblical ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages her abbey target beginning has a crosshair target which is interpreted spiritually the first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread  the bread on fire with the holy spirit the same stage of development as the child in marys womb when she arrived at her cousin elizabeths house 
postabort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed but emotionally reacted to in art and word father x describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals this contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds at another point fatherx imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus a roar of unwanted thoughts troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
father x elaborates on what gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion he cites a world built on slavery before christs advent and the works of such men as william wilberforce and john brown in furthering christs gospel of justice and peace all this is contrasted to abortion throughout 
ruminating on gaits palms of our lord father x claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion palms is murky with a single red hand print to look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the tarot of ruins he continues 
suicide advances this dark theme where gait and father x criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics he takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings  a caricature of a woman who made a mistake who got herself in trouble who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart 
but all isnt baleful and sad here in cloud children father x muses on paper dolls in gaits paintings with this lovely thought where children go  is a mystery  some say they take their daytime rest in christs tomb in jerusalem and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled star ships 
 troubadours sailing hibiscus seas  is a work of meditation grief counseling poetry social commentary and visual art father x may not reveal his identity here but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child gait and father x describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families those phantoms of sorrows who will never laugh or cry together as a family because of an abortion they hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way

when judith gait met father x it was a lopsided grief that drew them together he had lost his only chance at fatherhood through an abortion years ago gait is a married mother of five and longterm american resident in britain her support of the prolife movement is driven by thankfulness and praise for life and her christian faith 
witnessing abortions heavy toll on the living and dead gait began to make the paintings almost no one else seemed to be doing subtle and working entirely with symbolism these simple artworks avoid screaming about abortion rather they mourn in color symbol and tone with single shoes broken cord dead flowers and other lonely and broken things troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
when a friend first visited gaits studio he was struck by her abortion paintings confessing years of torment after his partner aborted his child he wrote i realize your work comes from a place of great love for it attempts to give defenseless life the dignity and protection it never knew in our throw away culture 
gait invited him to pray with her for his lost child it happened to be the anniversary of the death of his baby five years to the day father x remembers every detail 
their conversation grew into a joint effort culminating in a book  troubadours sailing hibiscus seas meditations on post abortion trauma  father x wanted to remain anonymous as a placesetter for millions of unconsidered fathers in the acts of abortion he wrote poetic and powerful statements for each of gaits  paintings in this book which have also been shown together in art exhibits 
time and neglect does not necessarily heal the wounds of abortion gait claims rather the past refocuses into a sharper image and the pain through an iterative process of silence guilt and remorse has not abated you can see that in the words of father x which run the gamut of human emotions on abortion shoe pot and crossesfrom troubadours sailing hibiscus seas 
jonah of nineveh features an upended single rose with red cords and funereal foliage flowers are already in the birth position head down and waiting to be born torn and shroudlike ribbons hang across the painting spirals represent a childs dna helix and the veil of the temple which has just been so rudely shaken down to its foundation father x makes an analogy between jonah fleeing parental responsibility and eventual redemption  then veers off to his own personal engulfment in almost a stream of consciousness it was her wedding dress my sea green empress this blue lagoon princess she slipped into her own heart of darkness on that day she decided to abort and when time really stopped in our lives she was full of fear  
in some of these works hammers incongruently hang with flowers they are bloody or blackened some submerged underwater or hanging from a noose father x interprets these tools as decision markers to either build or tear down in hammer of decision it belongs to thor the war god infested with his one eyed wisdom of intrigue and destruction wagner the olympics sperm races thomas moore and valkyries are all inducted into this choice by the author either the carpenters hammer of wisdom or thors tool of chaos will be chosen by expectant parents hammer suspended 
 troubadours  runs from elegant poetry to sentiment over babies and an ad hoc theology striving to extend lives of children lost to abortion the authors create a fantasy universe of possibilities this includes moonlighting for angels celestial games interstellar windjammers and a baby steamer sailing on childrens seas among other delightful prospects lost and murdered infants in these tales pine for love or for a family in their limbos 
father x occasionally speculates on spiritual issues outside the bible or the treatment of abortion in other religions running from nursery rhymes and quotes to historical characters these are not theological statements but a type of literary yearning that seeks an answer to abortion 
in gaits pink rose and stardust we see empty fields withered plants and other tokens father x takes off from here on fanciful trips for the lost children he places them in a cosmic waiting rooms or dancing in circles which is reflected in the painting children are disfigured or missing eyes or arms and singing in low mournful tones so as not to disturb their parents music is intense equivalent to the sound created by hildegard von bingen a thcentury nun and composer troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
references to mary as a mother are common as well as other scriptural allusions all babies jump for jesus in the womb or in its sack of nibbling yoke writes father x elizabeths child john leapt for joy just as his ancestor david did before the ark of the covenant he continues 
gait addresses the human embryo finding biblical ethical or emotional arguments for its worth at all stages her abbey target beginning has a crosshair target which is interpreted spiritually the first target blastula conflates the first cellular divisions with the laver bread  the bread on fire with the holy spirit the same stage of development as the child in marys womb when she arrived at her cousin elizabeths house 
postabort guilt isnt rationalized or downplayed but emotionally reacted to in art and word father x describes bats as whirling about in circles at the pitiful sound the aborted children make because they are tuned to such distressing signals this contrasts with many parents who are still stone deaf to such mournful sounds at another point fatherx imputes the collective white noise of guilt to attacks of tinnitus a roar of unwanted thoughts troubadours sailing hibiscus seaspainting by judith gait commentary by father x 
father x elaborates on what gait hints in her paintings the injustice and evil of abortion he cites a world built on slavery before christs advent and the works of such men as william wilberforce and john brown in furthering christs gospel of justice and peace all this is contrasted to abortion throughout 
ruminating on gaits palms of our lord father x claims the face of the baby is in the midst of the ruins of the abortion palms is murky with a single red hand print to look at the after birth of an abortion is to read the tarot of ruins he continues 
suicide advances this dark theme where gait and father x criticize the death industry and its euphemistically named clinics he takes a few swings at the girl gangs of the glass ceilings  a caricature of a woman who made a mistake who got herself in trouble who has had an abortion and afterwards committed suicide in her heart 
but all isnt baleful and sad here in cloud children father x muses on paper dolls in gaits paintings with this lovely thought where children go  is a mystery  some say they take their daytime rest in christs tomb in jerusalem and like him when their time is come they will ascend into heaven before a quire of angels and assembled star ships 
 troubadours sailing hibiscus seas  is a work of meditation grief counseling poetry social commentary and visual art father x may not reveal his identity here but the reader comes to know intimate details about relationships and emotions surrounding the death of his only child gait and father x describe their efforts as a silent prayer of witness for all the ghost families those phantoms of sorrows who will never laugh or cry together as a family because of an abortion they hope that prying open the tightly locked matter of abortion will help to heal those who have had abortions or are victimized in some way 
judith gait is a graduate of california college of arts and crafts and received a masters at oxfords ruskin school of fine drawing her work is in public and private collections in america and abroad she is an american citizen residing in britain father x is an addictions counselor and writer in great britain who prefers to remain anonymous
